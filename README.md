# TA-Reddit-Strike-Analysis-For-Daily-Nexus

This repository is the Reddit portion (my contribution!) to the 3 part (1 part assigned to each person) TA Strike Analysis consisting of Reddit, Twitter, and Discord data. After scraping reddit posts with PRAW, I analyzed trends in UCSB Student responses to the UAW strike through sentiment analysis. The final, combined research+visualizations will be completed in the middle of January and published as an article for the Daily Nexus.
