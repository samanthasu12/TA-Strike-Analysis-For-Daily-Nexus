Academic  workers in the United Auto Workers, across the expansive 10-campus  University of California system, have voted by 98 percent for strike  authorization over the past week.

A  strike date has been  set for the coming Monday, November 14, for  48,000 workers, including:  12,000 postdoctoral and academic researchers  in Local 5810, who have  been working without a contract since  September 30; 19,000 tutors, readers and graduate student instructors  and assistants in Local 2865, who have been kept on the job after  numerous extensions were allowed  since the June 30, 2020 contract  expiration; and 17,000 grad students in the Student Researchers United  (SRU-UAW), which was recognized in  December. 

The  overwhelming strike authorization is an expression of the desire of  workers everywhere to halt decades of attacks on their living and  working conditions and crushing 9 percent inflation.

UC workers are part of a powerful global strike wave, which includes [55,000 Ontario education support workers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/08/eqqe-n08.html),  who are battling the Canadian provincial Ford government. The US strike   is also taking place as auto workers, university workers and other  workers in the UAW are voting in presidential elections, where [Will Lehman, a socialist autoworker running for UAW president](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/), is fighting to give power to the rank and file. 

Academic   workers—many of whom have families—are spending the majority of their   paltry income on skyrocketing rents, and numerous UC campuses are  located in the most expensive cities in California. Many are living hand   to mouth, describing [horrible living conditions](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/10/27/qeuk-o27.html)   that include health hazards, the inability to afford day care, food   insecurity and going without meals. They are demanding an end to their   precarious financial situation. 

While  claiming there is no money to provide living wages for academic  workers, the assets of the UC  system stand at $152.3 billion as of the  end of the 2021-2022 academic  year, according to the UC Office of the  President. The largest public institution of higher learning in the  world spans the entire state of California, with 10 campuses, five  medical centers, one law school, 16 health professional schools, three  national laboratories and numerous satellite facilities. 

The  University of California is the largest  non-governmental employer in  the state of California, which, if ranked as an independent country, has  one of the largest economies in the  world.

The  reality is that the academic workers are the cheap labor workhorses   that run the massive multibillion-dollar UC system. Workers are in a  powerful position to win all of their demands and expand the global   fight for wages and improvements. Such a victory, however, requires that   workers take control of their struggle from the grips of the UAW  apparatus, which has forced its membership to accept decade after decade   of wage cuts and concessionary contracts.

Hence I'm currently looking at my grades on gauchospace but have some confusion about the '**Course total Include empty grades**' part.

All of my grades for assignments and quizzes have been input with the corr. grade weight with the exception of the last assignment worth 20%, which I do not expect to do well on. As it is, my '**Course total Include empty grades**' is barely hovering above a C grade. 

Does this mean my current percentage score is excluding the last 20% (aka after all grades have been inputted, the percentage will only go up even if I don't get a good score on the last assignment) or that number could go up or down depending on my final assignment grade?

Among tenure-line faculty, outright cancelation of classes and finals is a violation of the Faculty Code of Conduct.  Professors are required to teach their classes.  All professors have been reminded of this repeatedly by the university adminsitration. The only way a professor can strike legally is by going on an unpaid leave.  But very few professors who've just canceled classes are doing that.  Not only is this unfair to students, it's also unfair to other professors who are doing their jobs to give students get the education they were promised.

Of course, professors have had to adjust their classes to the new reality.  It is okay for professors to modify class expectations.  But the new challenges don't just exempt professors from doing their jobs.   And they've been told repeatedly that they can't just skip out on the rest of the quarter or withhold your grades.

Thus, I think our calculus in the contract ratification vote cannot be driven by proximity to the ideal, but has to be driven by whether we think that the substantial increases and rights that will be had under this contract are worth throwing away for the hope of something better that might or might not come after a NO vote and after the ensuing struggle (accounting, among other things, for the impact of impasse if it happens and the difficulty of maintaining a potential monthslong strike during impasse and/or mobilizing to restart the strike afterward). Personally, I feel that after the substantial gains seen in mediation, this contract is now good enough to vote YES. A NO vote brings a lot of uncertainty and could end up hurting many people for little or no gain. Your assessment of the outcomes for the options may vary, but I think a comparison of these outcomes is the correct framing for the choice.

I'll add that I totally agree with your comment regarding ""holding undergrad education hostage.""

Basically, this guy has approached me several times over the course of a year, all in different locations/stores around town and also on campus. It’s always the same story- he tries to strike up a conversation, usually with a compliment, and get my number. At first, I dismissed it as classic guy behavior, but it kept happening: In target, in front of the lib, even all the way downtown in Sephora. Weirdest thing is that each time he doesn’t seem to remember me. Seems like he may just be going to public places and waiting around for girls to talk to.

The last time, I engaged him in conversation and he told me he was a grad student here, but UCPD ran the name he gave me and it’s not anywhere in the system. 

Friends of mine have noticed him lurking around the bus stop talking to girls and when he approached me in target, I saw him doing the same thing to other girls after.

Of course it’s not technically illegal to approach women in public, but it’s absolutely concerning that this has happened to me by chance so many times and I bet I’m not the only one.

It’s incredibly frustrating to me that out campus union leadership won’t even acknowledge this.

So maybe we’ll vote no and the strike will continue, but it will be without my support. And I know many colleges who feel similarly.

# ----- TLDR version -----

**1. You get paid to go to school, right?**

We get paid, yes. But after the first year, we’re “students” in name only: we work full-time teaching and doing research—work that the university profits from.

**2. How much do you get paid?**

[About $24-39k/year](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu), varying each quarter depending on many factors.

**3. Don’t you only work 20 hours/week?**

lmao no.

**4. So you work 40 hours/week?**

lol, if only.

**5. Where does the demand for $54k/year come from?**

In short, it’s the number that will ensure that every UC graduate worker makes enough to live.

**6. Isn’t $54k way too much?**

No. If the university had to hire replacements for all the striking grad workers tomorrow, it’d have to pay them [market rates of $40k-$60k](https://www1.salary.com/Salaries-for-Researcher-I-Academic-with-a-Masters-Degree-or-MBA).

**7. But surely we don’t have the money? Where’s it supposed to come from? Wouldn’t my tuition need to increase?**

Yes, UC does have the money. No, tuition needn’t increase. One-tenth of the annual interest on the [endowment](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/ucs-investment-assets-close-fiscal-year-152-billion) would meet the demands in full, and TA salaries currently represent less than 10% of [tuition](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/revenue-and-expense-data). And I’m sure there are other UCSB expenditures that make you say “Really? My tuition is paying for \*this\*?”

**8. Wait, so only a small fraction of my massive tuition goes to the people actually teaching me?**

Yes.

**9. How is that possible?**

The UC, along with all of US public higher education, has gradually [privatized](https://www.dailycal.org/2017/08/29/privatization-increases-inequality-cuts-education-quality) over the past half-century, and now has [more administrators than educators](https://dailybruin.com/2018/09/19/administrative-bloat-budget-mismanagement-explain-ucs-falling-global-rankings). The effect of this has been maximizing revenues (tuition), minimizing cost (worker salaries), and funneling the difference back into the administrative class.

**10. Shouldn’t we be really, really angry about that?**

Yes.

**11. How can we help?**

* Spread the word
* Ask your TAs
* Communicate your support to your professors
* Call (and/or have parents call) [Chancellor Yang’s office](https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/contacts)
* [Join the picket line](https://www.fairucnow.org/picket/)
* Promote the [strike fund](https://givebutter.com/uc-uaw)

# ----- Long-form FAQ -----

&#x200B;

**1. You get paid to go to school, right?**

We get paid, yes. But after the first year, we’re “students” in name only: we work full-time teaching and doing research—work that the university profits from. Though we don’t take classes after the first year, the university still charges us “tuition”, and either (if we don’t have a TAship) siphons that money from research grants or (if we have a TAship) just moves some bits around in a computer and makes it go away.

&#x200B;

**2. How much do you get paid?**

At UCSB, [about $24-39k/year](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu), depending on many factors:

* Whether your advisor pays you from research grant money
* Whether you have a TAship
* Whether you get a fellowship
* Whether you can secure funding for the summer
* Which department you are in

These factors are mostly outside of your control, and funding shifts from one quarter to the next. This uncertainty is one of the worst parts of the grad school experience and fosters a counterproductive [scarcity mentality](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-scarcity-mentality). 

&#x200B;

**3. Don’t you only work 20 hours/week?**

No. On paper, the university has to claim that we only work “part-time” in order to legally call us “students”. In practice, nobody expects you to only work 20 hours. If you have a TAship, you teach up to 20 hours/week and do research work the rest of the week. Otherwise, you do research work full-time.

&#x200B;

**4. So you work 40 hours/week?**

Also no. This is one of the cruel ironies of thinking of it as grad “school” rather than as an early-career job: you never stop doing it. The building never shuts down; nights, weekends, and holidays are all fair game. Even away from the lab, you’re doing the intellectual work of planning experiments; even when hanging out with friends, you’re burdened with the thought that you can and should be working toward your dissertation so you can get the hell out of there.

Based on [survey data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03419-8), the average PhD student works 50 hours/week, and 70-hour work weeks are common. And of course, the faculty had to work long hours to get where they are, so they expect the same of their students.

&#x200B;

**5. Where does the demand for $54k/year come from?**

My understanding is that there was some disagreement in the union about whether to demand different amounts for different campuses, departments, and job titles (e.g. like a 50% raise for everyone from their current salary, plus housing assistance matched to the cost of living near each campus). In the end, the decision was made to demand a single number for everyone, since that would be much easier to communicate, understand, and rally around. $54,000/year is the salary required to make sure every grad worker in every department at every campus from San Diego to Davis will have a living wage.

&#x200B;

**6. Isn’t $54k way too much?**

Answering this requires assessing the value of the work that grads perform. One way to do that is to look at cost-of-replacement: what would the university have to pay to replace grad workers if they actually had to compete for them in a free market?

[Private-sector entry-level research jobs](https://www1.salary.com/Salaries-for-Researcher-I-Academic-with-a-Masters-Degree-or-MBA) average over $50k at Bachelor’s level (equivalent to a 1st or 2nd year PhD student) and around $60k at Master’s level (equivalent to a 3rd year PhD student).

The value of the teaching work is harder to assess since educators are so tragically underpaid in this country, but an appropriate analog might be [entry-level high school science teachers](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/high-school-science-teacher-salary/ca), who make between $40k and $50k.

Another interesting point of reference: working full-time at In N Out in Goleta currently pays about $40k/year ($20/h).

In short: no, $54k does not overvalue the labor of graduate workers, if you think of them as “workers” (people who earn a salary) rather than “students” (which is often code for “people who I think should be going to bed hungry every night”).

That said, in my opinion the eventual contract will probably end up somewhere between $54k and the current average of low-mid 30s, perhaps in the mid-high 40s.

&#x200B;

**7. But surely we don’t have the money? Where’s the money supposed to come from? Would my tuition need to go up?**

Doing some back-of-envelope calculations, meeting the demands in full would cost about an additional $15-20k/year for the average employee covered by the striking units (ASEs, GSRs, ARs, and Postdocs). Multiplied by the 48,000 covered employees, that’s about $800 million, which would be a 1.9% increase in the [UC’s 2021 budget](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/revenue-and-expense-data) of >$41 billion. It’s significant but feasible, especially since we’re reaching a breaking point where 25% of the UC’s workforce—the ones who do the bulk of the work that actually make the university a university—won’t be able to afford to live. If your house is about to collapse, and fixing it will increase your annual expenses by 1.9%, you’ll find the money.

As for where, exactly, the money should come from… If you’re still reading this, you probably have some ideas. I’m not an accountant or administrator, but here are some numbers for scale.

* The university’s [endowment](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/ucs-investment-assets-close-fiscal-year-152-billion) is on the order of $10^(11) and grows by over $10^(10)/year.
* Meeting the union’s demands in full would cost under $10^(9)/ year.
* The university collects over $5x10^(9)/year in tuition.
* TA salaries total under $5x10^(8)/year (about $26k x 19,000).
* The UC has more than [twice as many](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/uc-employee-headcount) non-academic staff (over 150,000) as academic staff (70,000).

Good luck finding precise data about how much is spent on all those administrators, since UC just groups its budget into broad categories like “instructional support”. But again, some back-of-envelope calculations: if you cut the admin:faculty ratio in half, back to 1990s levels, and each admin makes $60k on average, you’d save over $4 billion/year.

In short, UC has the money. As usual, it’s a question of distribution, not amount. Personally, I know what I’d cut, but the problem at hand is ensuring that the people making the university run are paid enough to live, not figuring out which administrative departments to trim to make it happen. They have armies of managers and accountants dedicated to that; they’ll figure it out. 

&#x200B;

**8. Wait, so only a small fraction of my massive tuition goes to the people actually teaching me?**

Yes.

&#x200B;

**9. How can that be possible?**

In a few words: [privatization](https://www.dailycal.org/2017/08/29/privatization-increases-inequality-cuts-education-quality) and [administrative bloat](https://academic.oup.com/book/40915/chapter-abstract/349089301?redirectedFrom=fulltext). The number of administrators has about quadrupled since 1970, while tenure-track faculty less than doubled. Between 2004 and 2014 alone, the number of administrators [increased by 60%](https://dailybruin.com/2018/09/19/administrative-bloat-budget-mismanagement-explain-ucs-falling-global-rankings). There are now [more administrators than educators](https://capitolweekly.net/tuition-uc-administrators-tripled-csu-data/) or researchers in this educational research institution.

Academia was highlighted by David Graeber in his 2018 book, [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), for its trend over the past 50 years of creating new positions just so that the person in the old position can have a new title. Many, many of these administrative positions involve little actual productive work. They forward e-mails to listservs, sit in unnecessary meetings, and send PDF forms back and forth to each other. Any student reading this has experienced the futile rage of having an administrator respond to your question with an e-mail telling you to “check the website”.

Combine all this with the symbolic observation that the people at the top are making CEO-level pay—something like 50 times more than the lowest-paid graduate workers. Is Michael Drake’s job hard? I’m sure. Does he provide $1 million of value -- 50 times more than a TA or researcher -- to the university? Color me skeptical.

The bottom line is, perhaps counterintuitively, paying graduate workers a living wage need not mean increasing tuition. **Underpaid workers and overinflated tuition are both symptoms of the steady privatization of the University of California.** Rather than a public institution focused on producing education and research for the benefit of the state’s citizenry, the UC is being run as a very large, very inefficient, state-subsidized, for-profit corporation.

&#x200B;

**10. Shouldn’t we be really, really angry about that?**

Yes.

&#x200B;

**11. What can we do to help?**

* Talk about it with friends and family
* Talk about it on social media
* Send your TAs messages of support and ask how you can help
* Communicate your support to your professors
* [Call](https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/contacts) (and/or tell your parents to call) UCSB to ask why they are charging you tuition but failing to provide the education you paid for
* Study at the [picket line](https://www.fairucnow.org/picket/)
* Join and speak at marches and rallies
* If you or someone you know has excess resources, consider contributing to the [strike fund](https://givebutter.com/uc-uaw)
* Practice self-care. Prioritize your education.
* Remember that the university chose this. They could have settled the contract over the summer, and didn’t.","No, that's not what it means. Bargaining in good faith means that the University will meet to negotiate with the union bargaining team at reasonable times that work for both parties, and will not bargain with individuals outside of official negotiation.

Recently, the UC was 40 minutes late to an evening bargaining session. Tactics like this can be used to prevent or reduce time for the union side to caucus (which is when we meet as union members to discuss our/the university's proposals), or reduce the number of union members who are able to make it to the bargaining session. It's dirty play.

Additionally, last week, the California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB, the board that governs labor disputes in California), issued six complaints against the UC for bargaining in bad faith. This includes things like changing workers' pay without going through official negotiation with our union.

1. They are literally still students. Students are supposed to pay to learn and not earn. Some European countries even require grad students to pay tuition and other fees while they look for funding by applying for scholarships. No regular stipend is guaranteed.
2. Academia is a business which doesn't scale. There is supply and demand. The demand stays constant or increases very little. If you hate your wages so much, quit your jobs and the demand will increase which will increase the wage.

15,"There's a strong caveat to this. Graduate students work full time on research and teaching, but are only paid 20 hours per week. This way, the university can get out of providing certain benefits that full-time workers would normally get, and use the guise of ""working students"" to charge tuition prices to research grants despite the vast majority of PhD students only being enrolled in dummy ""reading"" credits after year 1. So while the adjusted salary may legally be higher ""per hour"", that does not reflect the true amount of labor the university receives, or the large amount of money the university gets from GSR tuition fees, aka workers paying their employer to work.","Aye can you chill with the drum?

21,,"Look, I think the chancellors should be payed way less as much as anybody, but in truth their salaries are a drop in the bucket for what the UC is throwing around.

INFO:
 - For the 2021-2022 school year the UC system had an overall budget of $41.6 billion

 - Of this $41 billion: 39% is from Medical centers, 21% is from Sales and services, 11% is from Government contracts/grants, 7% is from private support, and 21% is from the State and UC general funds as well as our tuition and fees

- HOWEVER, the important sector we are considering is the 21%, known as the core funds and amounting to around $9 billion

 - These core funds are allocated out into four main sectors: 15% is for equipment and other supplies, 16% is for financial aid, 19% is for employee benefits, and 50% is for Faculty and Staff salaries (where our TAs and everybody else resides)

- This $4.5 billion is what is paying pretty much everybody's salaries, and while the Chancellors are obviously payed way too much, there's a lot more money that needs to be moved around than just reducing executive salaries in order to give the graduate student workers the living wage that they deserve

 - ""Union officials say the cost is likely to be as much as $2 billion -- but still say that is 'just 4.5% of UC's total budget' of 46.4 billion"" (San Francisco Chronicle)

(If checked again with the new fiscal reports some of these numbers are likely to be a few million higher for the 2022-2023 school year, with the total budget going up a couple billion, but the overall message stands)

While I understand TAs want a raise, and they do deserve a raise, I believe the amount they’re asking for is ludicrous. In my opinion, what the strike should actually be about is being paid for the actual amount of work they do. That is a common theme amongst them, that they work more than their contract. In my eyes, either don’t work more than your contract regardless of the pressure, or fight to be paid for more hours. If all the TAs only did 20 hours of work a week rather than caving to pressure, I feel that sends more of a message when grades are late, because then professors also take some slack. Not to mention, they signed a contract before starting work and before coming here. The fact that they saw their pay, saw the housing prices, and still committed to it shouldn’t be my problem. Research and most of their tuition is paid for, either they fight for having more hours written on those contracts or they get a second job, regardless they knew what they were signing up for. 

In addition, I hate that I am being used as a bargaining chip. Why are my grades and education being used to fight their fight? I didn’t ask to be a part of that, I just want a thorough education. Especially given that I’m a fourth year, so half of my college education was online and screwed up due to covid. That’s already more tampering than I would’ve liked, and now I’m missing out more because of other people? I don’t appreciate that. In addition, I’ve had one lab class that was entirely halted because it was ran by TAs, and I am incredibly upset by this because I paid my full tuition cost for that class, to then only receive half of it? How is that fair? How is it fair to the undergrads to only get half of their grades, half of the education we rightfully paid for? I understand the TAs feel slighted, but I’m angry that they don’t care about the undergrads at all. 

Not to mention their choice of location for striking. In front of the library? When we’re winding down to finals and people are just trying to study? Seriously? Why can’t the TAs strike outside of admin buildings instead? The undergrads trying to study can’t do anything to change your situation, but the admin can. Go be vocal where they are.","Yes!

36,,"> (you are free to join and exit the strike as often as you like.)

Maybe you're more in-the-know than I am-- I think this is true of the *picket line* for non-striking workers, but my understanding is that only partially striking is not a legally protected activity. Non-striking workers can come show their support as often as possible while still completing all of their contractual duties, but it's important that striking workers do withhold *all* of their labor.

Three example scenarios:

1. A TA could still join the lunchtime rally and march and phone bank in the evening, while completing all of their teaching duties for the day. The full contractual duties having been fulfilled, the university would not legally be able to dock pay. However, the TA would not qualify for strike pay because they are not striking from their work.
2. A TA could cease all of their teaching duties and [perform all of the strike duties](https://www.fairucnow.org/strikefaq/) necessary to receive strike pay. The university would legally be allowed to dock their pay, but the TA could receive strike pay. Since the strike is legally protected, the university would not lawfully be able to fire the TA.
3. If a TA were to perform some teaching duties but shirk others, they would not be eligible for strike pay. In addition, the university could lawfully fire the TA for dereliction of duty.

As you noted, all of this depends on the university getting access to complete and accurate information about who is striking, which is not a given.","“plague the UCSB sub”

I have sixty students. Last week, only 10 students showed up. I finished grading midterms three weeks ago. It took me close to 30 hours grading them all and I typed up 3-page memos for all my students so they all know why they got the grade they received. I still have 15 blue books that were not claimed by students who on top of that just don’t even bother coming to class. Oh, and i hold 3 hours of office hours a week. I think I saw 4 students throughout the quarter. So complaining that you’re not getting the education you’re paying for is nice but many of y’all’s actions seem to suggest you really aren’t committed to your own education and are just complaining for the sake of complaining. 

Of course, there are always a handful of students who show they care. But that’s really a small minority of students. Maybe you all are part of that minority of diligent students, and if that’s the case, I commend you. But seeing y’all calling us lazy, and saying our work is “simple” really kind of hurts given the time we pour into making sure you have a good education.

Ps: for the record, I’m not trying to shift the blame to undergrads. I hate our union, they’re sellouts who have employed horrible negotiating tactics that have hurt undergrads, indeed. What I’m trying to say is, yes the union sucks, yes the strike has been largely useless so far, yes undergraduate students are unfairly impacted, but ALSO yes grad students have a horrible job that’s grossly underpaid and we deserve more, and yes some students find excuses to complain about the strike even though they’re not committed to their own education.

If you still think this strike is pointless and that grad students are acting entitled, then I don’t think I can change your mind.

We’re not just fighting for a raise right now, we’re not just upset because some TA’s work more than they should, we’re fighting against a system that has constantly undermines our rights as workers. We don’t get the same benefits that are granted by every other job. We are not treated as people by the UC system, just as workers they can exploit.

And I hope that this movement can be taken to other campuses, as many of the same problems occur elsewhere.","I do not really support some aspects of the strike for a few reasons.

The PhD candidates are getting paid proportionally to their bachelor's degree. They DO NOT have a PhD yet, so they are getting paid as if they have their bachelor's. Yes, they are getting paid \~24k, which appears below minimum wage. However, tuition is covered for them, which accounts for an extra \~30k+. They do not have a PhD yet, but they are working towards one for higher pay, so I think demanding 54k pay on top of the 30k for tuition is a little absurd. That's \~84k per year for 20 hours of TA work a week. I do understand TAs are being worked more than 20 hours a week, and that is completely unfair and warrants striking.

On top of that, I hear many testimonies of grad students saying the cost of living in California is significantly higher than their hometowns or their undergrad college towns. However, before starting your PhD here in California, how did you not take into account the high costs of living? I can completely understand working long hours, and that should 100% be fought for. When you are fighting for being rent burdened, but you did not do your research on California's high cost of living, then I see some logical gaps here. I'm not saying the grad students get paid enough to afford rent, I'm just saying the grad students not from California could have made a better informed decision on a grad school if they did some research on California's cost of living instead of now going ""I didn't expect it to be so expensive to live in California.""

There are other reasons as well but this post is getting kind of long.

TLDR; I do hope the grad students get enough compensation to live in California. But, I don't really agree with some of the complaints.","2% is way too low. Hell you claim seniors are fixed income, what about that fat COLA raise on social security this year. Fixed my ass. You know who won’t be getting a 8% raise? Grad students.

I don’t need to hear about how you’re the best of your absolute scum of a generation. A list of things your generation has done:

+Developed land for your own needs, building out sprawling suburbs to carve out your piece. Often buying multiple properties to further over consume a scarce resource. You view housing as an “investment” not giving a shit that it’s a necessity of life.
+To amplify your “investments” you created artificial scarcity in the market once you “got yours” by putting in NIMBY policies
+You raped and pillaged our earth by over extracting resources all in the name of “capitalism”, all so you could drive your damn SUV that have gotten bigger and bigger to live in your houses that have gotten bigger and bigger. They should call you the generation of excess.
+Under your generations watch GHG emissions have not only grown, they have ACCELERATED

Honestly the biggest piece of shit generation yo ever grace this earth. The world will become immediately better once you’re all six feet under. I won’t do a damn thing yo help you as you walk towards your grave either, your generation refuses to lift a finger to help ours.",,"TAs work more than 20hrs a week. It may be in our contract that it’s only 20, but that doesn’t reflect reality.

Edit: I’m muting replies to this comment. I appreciate all the sincere questions I’ve gotten, and I’ve done my best to answer them! I don’t have all of the answers regarding the strike, as I’m not a bargaining team member. I’m just a grad student who wants to see some positive change in the future. If you still think this strike is pointless and that grad students are acting entitled, then I don’t think I can change your mind.

We’re not just fighting for a raise right now, we’re not just upset because some TA’s work more than they should, we’re fighting against a system that has constantly undermines our rights as workers. We don’t get the same benefits that are granted by every other job. We are not treated as people by the UC system, just as workers they can exploit. We’re fighting to make sure our voices are heard by the UC system so that we can ensure fair working conditions for us and for future grad students at UC schools.

Whatever one thinks of this or that issue, it seems hard to deny that there is a sting “flattening” effect on the opinions heard at UCSB. An ironically orthodox anti-status quo (be it TMT, Munger Hall, or the strike) “consensus” has very successfully silence those with many degrees of dissenting opinion.

This orthodoxy persists (it seems to me) by being genuinely popular among students. But it also uses intimidation, attacking those with mildly diverging points of view on personal rather than intellectual grounds, attempting mainly to get them to stop talking rather than to changer their minds.

Many students are afraid to offer dissenting points of view. This ought to be a tragedy whatever way you slice it.","Graduate students are both employees of the university and students; focusing solely on the student side is disingenuous and reductive. And it gets tiring seeing the same misunderstandings regarding what grad students do and what the reality of our work is.  

First off, we often work more than the 20 hours a week people keep tossing around. Our contracts require us to work no more than that, but there’s no timekeeping or anything of the sort. Nobody ever checks, and the reality is that it often takes more time than that to get the work we need to do done. And working 30 hour contracts isn’t uncommon either, especially given that there’s actually a lack of sufficient TAs in many departments right now. 

Second, we don’t just teach sections and grade, but oftentimes teach many of the intro courses and even some higher divs. I’ve taught several large lecture courses and a few upper division courses as a grad student, though undergrads don’t seem to realize I’m a grad student when I do so. I do the exact same work as a full professor does in their classes: developing the course, choosing the readings, writing all the assignments and tests, preparing lectures, managing the TAs, and so on. The main difference is I’m paid barely anything for all that extra work, only $100 a month or so over what I make as a TA. And I definitely don’t get all that work done in only 20 hours a week. 

We are aware of what we will make when we start our programs. However, PhDs take around 5-7 years depending on the field. Our pay has not kept pace with how quickly housing and other costs have risen in much of California. And the university has cut back on things like grad housing guarantees to make room for more undergrads, which only exacerbates the issue. 5 years or so ago it was perfectly doable to live here with the money they gave us, not comfortable but at least workable. Nowadays, not so much. I’ve personally only managed to get by the past few years by picking up extra sections and later teaching full courses.  

I don’t think anyone honestly thinks that we will get anywhere near the 50k that’s being requested; starting that high is purely a bargaining tactic. But I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask that the people who do much of the grunt work at the university, and without whom it wouldn’t function, be paid enough to at least get by.",,"this is Reddit.… that being said I do think the majority of the school supports the strike but most people Ik are pretty indifferent towards it.

It's an honest question I have if you or anyone else may know the question.","I dont like the strike and i'll explain why.
1) I was around when COLA started here, and i knew some of the people from my department who were instrumental in the beginning. I know for a fact that they reported fabricated and gross misrepresentations of the financial situations of graduate students to the news media. Most of the most vocal people i know who are involved came to UCSB looking for a fight to pick. 
2) I worked in the real world for 10 years before coming to grad school, and after getting my PhD i now have life at work after grad school experience. I can tell you that the pay/benefits/free degree from UCSB in exchange for TA'ing, which is by far the easiest job i have ever done, is one of the best deals i've ever gotten. So most of these kids come off as very entitled and out of touch.
3) Myself and pretty much everyone else i know was able to find affordable housing. Just last night my GF found a cute little 1 bedroom for $1000 a month. I was paying $600 with 5 roommates in a nice house. I think these people really dont understand how to look for housing. Maybe ask the people around you?
4) This strike is making the other TA's who just want to focus on their research have to pick up the slack and its pissing them off. Sorry but i side with the people who make the most of life's lemons and sincerely want to focus on their research. All of the leading strikers i know are not productive researchers (it's well know in my department). 
5) The demands and arguments i've heard do not seem reasonable or coherent. I'm all for supporting an salary adjustment for inflation, and increasing the pay in other departments to match that of STEM. But these guys are asking to make what I make in industry (working a real job with a PhD). Reality is gonna hit like a ton of bricks when they leave grad school.","Only TAs wages come from tuition dollars, grad students paid to do research are paid directly by professors by research grants.

The PhD is better described as a master-apprentice relationship. It is not enough to take classes to train an academic that can produce useful original research. Instead one needs to learn how to work in a research community which involves a lot of skills which sadly undergraduate coursework do not even touch upon, such as: learning to read (and filter) current papers everyday, communicate to other researchers, plan and develop research projects from nothing, write a research paper which can pass peer review scrutiny, write grants to get money from companies and government, and even (for older grad students) mentor younger students, to name just a few. Historically many graduate student were not even paid, but instead lived off their family wealth. This meant only very wealthy people did research, or the fortunate few who had patrons to support them. The stipend serves to help draw in more talent from the general population.

The current academic system, to my knowledge, originated in Germany before WW2, where a lot of modern science was developed. This system immigrated to the USA and is the partial reason why the US is the dominate force in research (and weapons development. )

In many western countries graduate student do not even TA classes and are paid stipends from the government. In the UK, for example, TAing a class is done by volunteer grad students.  In the US, however academic research and undergraduate education have been intimated tied. The trouble is that many departments do not consider the undergraduate services when they admit students, instead they think about research output.

One consequence is that **some** departments decide to get more grad students by paying a lower rate to do research. Hence why there are 10 tiers for paying grad students which is, in part, based on prestige and ""the market"". This leads to professors having very large groups where everyone is paid poorly. This is good for the professor because more research papers = more money and prestige. People tolerate this because the average (or at least a good number I know) graduate student is from a privileged background and often gets family support. This is fine for some, but establishes a norm where normal people attempt to do a PhD ( in part out of idealism) and get into a risky financial situation.",,"Genuine question.

40,,"Yeah...payroll is pretty BS...like depending on the month you technically get paid a day late (required to be paid 30 days after you work). In theory, we could push hard for biweekly pay -- but that would be a huge hassle and a fight no one is really wanting to take on right now, even with the strikes and everything. The bigger issue, I think, is the 9 months of being paid, 3 months of being off. That's what is total BS.","So the way TA appointments work currently is that you can only work part time (50%) during the school year. As it is, we don’t need to log hours as TA’s to get our pay, it’s just something we are recommended to do in case we are asked to do more work than we are paid for. I’m guessing that salary will stay static unless someone files a grievance due to working more than 20 hours. If that happens, more compensation may be provided but it won’t necessarily be 108k it would depend on how many hour they go over. I hope that answers your question.","Yes I am one of them. Here are some of my reasons. 
1. Ridiculous demands ($52 an hour+ for fairly simple work) they do deserve some increase I think but not 54k a year as a blanket minimum. Also, no your personal thesis research shouldn’t count as time spent working. 

2. Fiscally imprudent (where will this money come from?)

3. Communist/unrelated causes the movement associates with (ie: “Land Back F*** Cops”)

4. Loud, corny, repetitive chants outside the library and ugly chalk all over campus that they don’t want to be erased. 

5. I might go to grad school in future and I believe this will make it harder for me to get one of these positions and will significantly increase the expectations associated with the position.

41,,Thank you so much for the info. Yes I am a union member already.,"Part of bargaining is that we will eventually need to reach a compromise, so it’s better to start high. We probably won’t get exactly 54k, but if we start bargaining with a lower number, the university will probably make us a worse offer. The other reason why 54k was suggested is that to not be considered rent burdened, only 30% of your income should go towards rent. 54k is the amount we need to get out of being rent burdened.

I get that not all TAs go over 20 hours a week, but I think it would be nice to have a more sustainable salary.","I absolutely HATED when they woke me up at 5am multiple days in a row because they were blasting music outside my dorm for hours.

It's true and sad that grad students do a lot more work than what's written in the contracts. But again, no one forced you take these jobs. It's not a secret that grad students are overburdened. That is just the nature of academia.

I agree though that the wages should keep up with the housing costs.

42,,"That's not enough to prove who's striking (e.g., a TA could be sick, or be out of town, etc). If the university does not pay someone who is not striking, that is illegal and they can then get grievances filed against them by the union, and then they have to pay more, etc etc. Also, beyond the university not knowing who is striking, it would be a pain in the ass to program into UC path who is not to be paid. (I have heard from some staff that this would be ""impossible"" to do, which is likely an exaggeration, but shows exactly how much of a pain in the ass it would be to go in and individually change paychecks for thousands of students.) 

As a unionized worker, you have a right to strike. You are allowed to exercise your right not to strike, but the strike is more powerful the more people who are involved. Everyone who is striking is fighting so YOU can have a higher wage. I know it's easier/safer to maintain the status quo, but I would encourage you to consider joining the strike to support your fellow workers who struggle to make ends meet here.

I pay this school way too much money to skip class.,"This is so incredibly untrue lol. Academia doesn’t follow the market logic of other businesses. PROFESSORS request TAs for their classes, not the university. It’s not like UCSB posts on LinkedIn looking for TAs… professors place requests and jobs are sent directly to grad students who are already enrolled. This is the case for the majority of the roles. So, no, they will not just hire less TAs because the university can’t control how many professors need TAs. That’s why they don’t want to offer more wages, because they WILL undoubtedly have to pay it. They can’t just hire less people and move on, they will continue to admit the same amount of students, professors will request the same amount of TAs and GSRs, and the UC will have to honor their contracts.

On top of that, grad student TAs and GSRs are not the only groups on strike, or whose contracts are being negotiated. There are undegrad Readers and TAs, Academic Researchers, Teaching Fellows, etc who are all demanding a living wage. So even if your hypothesis was remotely true, it still would only apply to a percentage of the people on strike.

And to your point about Grad Students not needing the money… do you seriously think the handful of people YOU spoke to can speak for the entire 48000 people on strike right now? Like be so fr. A large percent of grad students have kids. A large percent of grad students have dependents. Three of the UCs are located in the most expensive cities in the entire country.

43,,"One more thing, just because I heard some people weren't aware of it: **If** the UC does continue to pay us normally, we will eventually have to repay the ""strike pay"" to UAW. So don't like go on a shopping spree with it!","The definition of rent burdened is arbitrary and was constructed with the average worker in mind. Student TAs dont have your usual expenses that a working age adult would be encumbered with. 

I get that this may be part of a bargaining strategy but at the end of the day, the students who benefit from TAs will suffer the most from strikes. Better to nip this in the butt quickly and just be upfront with non-negotiables IMO.","Yeah, to be super clear — the union is not calling for undergrads to not attend class. I can’t find it for the life of me, but I remember one of the early-strike FAQ documents saying that if you saw someone saying that on behalf of the union, you should alert a strike captain because they really shouldn’t be doing that.

I’ve definitely seen individuals and other groups calling for an undergrad class boycott, but the union at large isn’t saying that. I think most grad students recognize that by boycotting classes, undergrads would be hurting themselves first and foremost… so yeah, I say do your thing.","Anecdotes concerning a few grad students you know personally aren’t exactly compelling or a good basis for generalizing. Financial burdens don’t hit everyone equally.  Many grad students receive outside assistance from family; people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are disproportionately represented among grad students. That some graduate students can make it work without being burdened doesn’t say much about the many others who aren’t as well-situated. Yes, you can make it work if you’re lucky and don’t have any excess expenses, like kids, medical bills, debt payments, and the like. But if you’re not getting outside help, you’re always one ER visit or mechanic bill away from not making rent that month. And you certainly aren’t saving for a car or eating out everyday; the math just doesn’t make sense on that one. 

I think it’s incredibly myopic to simply say that if someone takes a job that somehow negates any criticism they have about pay or working conditions, or that it’s just the nature of the profession. Whether we’re talking about grad students or workers more generally, things aren’t that simple. People’s healthcare and careers are tied up in their current jobs, working conditions change, cost of living changes, management and pay shifts, and it isn’t that simple to just quit and change jobs once you’re entrenched. 

And this hasn’t always been the nature of academia. The use of grad students as cheap teaching labor is a fairly recent phenomenon, starting in the late 80s and 90s, and is a direct result of both the cutting of federal funding to universities along the bloat of administrative budgets and the refusal to hire enough full professors. It’s tied into the same trends that lead universities to rely on poorly compensated adjuncts and lecturers instead of actual professors. 

A lot of this just sounds like the same simplistic and incurious arguments that have been given for decades to justify underpaying people across all sectors of the economy, ignoring the actual factors that have resulted in wages being as low as they are as well as the fact that these conditions are neither universal (either in this country or others) nor inevitable.  

I agree that undergrads shouldn’t be hurt, and I don’t agree with some of the strikers’ actions as a result. In fact, in all honesty I’m not even striking at the moment. But that wasn’t what your question concerned. Your question concerned why TA compensation is taken to be too low.

44,,"Fair point. But suppose the university was doing what I described above. We only have 2 sick days a quarter.  They’d only need to find us not holding sections on more than two separate days to come after us. Also, anyone could get reported to the university by a disgruntled student. Undergrads seem increasingly frustrated. It only takes one student snitching for the university to have grounds to withhold our pay. At least that’s how I think about it. I don’t know if that’s true from a legal standpoint, but that’s enough to deter me from joining the strike. I cannot risk losing my paycheck. I have a 1250 dollar rent to pay.

45,,Show up to the strike tables in front of the library or Elings Hall. Just ask for one and join the picket line,"This isn’t the point of the strike, I was just discussing TA hours. The main point of the strike is that the UC had committed several unfair labor practices, part of which does have to do with overworking us. The UC is also refusing to bargain with us over our contract. I’ve attended bargaining sessions where the UC purposefullu starts the meeting late, wastes our time during the meeting, and glosses over our concerns. The point of asking for a 54k salary is that TA’s manage a lot of the class work yet are severely rent burdened. A lot of us use at least half our salary on rent even if we live in student housing. For a so called prestigious university, it’s ridiculous that the people who do a lot of the teaching and research are paid so poorly. And if we are paid better, we could do our jobs better as we would no longer need to worry about how we will meet our basic needs.

Edit: ok I was a bit wrong about the ULPs, they are mainly about bargaining unfairly, not providing information, and changing compensations. But seeing as we are currently trying to bargain for new contracts to get better wages, get more protections about how we are treated (anti bullying), get better childcare, etc., I think it’s fair to still discuss wages, benefits, and our working environments. The strike may have been called because of unfair labor practices, but the root of the problem is our contracts and wanting a cost of living adjustment.","This is hardly unidirectional-- admin are happy to use students as bargaining chips whenever they can! ""Don't stop teaching; don't you care about the students? Look, everybody, the workers are harming our students!"" Remember that the university has had over a year to settle this contract, but has absolutely refused to bargain until their backs were put against the wall by this strike. If they really cared about students, they would have ensured that there would be no work stoppage by bargaining much earlier.","They also request the funding for GSRs yearly, and they choose how much they want to request every year. If they know they want 3 GSR’s and have to pay them 40k a year for instance, they will just request 120k+. Again, they have full discretion. So nothing will change. 
This is partially why soooo many of the professors support the strike. They were all grad students at a point themselves and they KNOW it’s a simple fix. A lot of Stem professors already do this on their own accord, they request excess money so they can pay their GSR’s a living wage, but it’s discouraged by the university. Only professors with high influence/prestige are allowed to do what they want. The negotiation rn is about the base wage. Getting a higher base wage would mean everyone can pay their TAs and GSRs a living wage with university approval. 
None of these things affect the supply or demand for these jobs.",,"This isn’t the point of the strike, I was just discussing TA hours. The main point of the strike is that the UC had committed several unfair labor practices, part of which does have to do with overworking us.

I’ve attended bargaining sessions where the UC purposefullu starts the meeting late, wastes our time during the meeting, and glosses over our concerns. The point of asking for a 54k salary is that TA’s manage a lot of the class work yet are severely rent burdened. A lot of us use at least half our salary on rent even if we live in student housing. For a so called prestigious university, it’s ridiculous that the people who do a lot of the teaching and research are paid so poorly. And if we are paid better, we could do our jobs better as we would no longer need to worry about how we will meet our basic needs.

Edit: ok I was a bit wrong about the ULPs, they are mainly about bargaining unfairly, not providing information, and changing compensations. But seeing as we are currently trying to bargain for new contracts to get better wages, get more protections about how we are treated (anti bullying), get better childcare, etc., I think it’s fair to still discuss wages, benefits, and our working environments. The strike may have been called because of unfair labor practices, but the root of the problem is our contracts and wanting a cost of living adjustment."

I strongly disagree. Most students, the majority of students, work very hard and are so swamped with trying to maintain their grades + extracurriculars + work (if they do) + relationships + a social life + probably a difficult home situation + MORE. Office hours are a low priority for students and many don’t have the luxury to attend. Other students don’t have the luxury to prioritize all their classes and might slack in one for the sake of others. Students might of been sick multiple times over the quarter and that prevents them from having motivation for any of their classes. “Diligent students” from what it seems you are saying are ones that prioritize your class for whichever reason; the ability to do that given the workload and situations they have, shows that your class is the most important for their career. I disagree with your final sentence. Most students, the vast majority, don’t even have the time to think about the strike and just trying to get by especially if they have a final coming up that determines 30% of their grade. Seems a lot of opinions are swayed by the voices of a few.","I get that folks are mad. I get that folks are striking. You realize this is precisely what top admin (Yang, some VCs, and above) want people fighting among themselves and not getting to the point. Folks are underpaid. I work in a field here at UCSB (Staff) where I could make roughly 40% by stepping into the private sector. I stay here because I believe in the mission. But the mistreatment and constant ""we don't get paid"" excuses I hear are making it more challenging. The nail in the coffin for many was the 28% raise over a few years for the Yang using the ""market determination"" excuse. Anytime I raise the market rate of jobs here at UCSB, I am shot down. So we need help to get good people and hire whoever is available. Thus, making it harder to get work done to facilitate the mission. I then read on these pages how horrible and overpaid all staff must be (I know, that's my feelings at that moment reading through things). The issue here is the mentality of Yang and many professors that staff are a waste of money. It depends on the staff and the situation, but they have kept staff wages down to the point where good staff that works very hard are leaving.  


To the parking piece. I would have been pissed as a student. As a staff member, I was just a few minutes late to a meeting.

55,,"> if you cut the admin:faculty ratio in half, back to 1990s levels, and each admin makes $60k on average, you’d save over $4 billion/year.

What staff would you cut here?  Do faculty want to go back to doing undergraduate advising?  Do we want to give up the gains we've made in student mental health services, disability services, etc.?  Would you close the national labs run by UC?

The staff are your allies here, I don't recommend throwing them under the bus.  Sure, you can point to specific administrator salaries, but you can take all of Chancellor Yang's 130k salary increase and give each Grad Student $40/year.  That's not where the money is.  The true reason that tuition went up was disinvestment by the California State Legislature in education.  The state use to pay near to 100% of the cost of an undergrad education from the general fund.  That is now below 20%.  That's where the money went, and why tuition is up.

> There are now more administrators than educators or researchers in this educational research institution.

Why wouldn't there be?  Faculty don't staff the dorms, or run the universities finances, or even maintain the university IT infrastructure. That is all done by staff.  Additionally, there has been a huge increase in federal research dollars going to campuses.  That money comes with strings, lots of them, and it takes administrators to ensure the rules are followed, and generate the effort reports and audit documents they require.",,"Lol this what I mean by the downvotes.

You seem to have a gross ignorance about the actual dynamics of the strike and the working and living conditions of grad student.

The money wouldn't be coming from your tuition either, I would recommend looking into the complex dynamics of the UC's budget-- TA wages have been pushed down for decades now to cut costs, resulting in the insane mismatch of wages vs cost of living. Also is is a mischaracterization to  say that grad students get it go to school for free,  phd students only really take  classes for the first few years and spend a majority of their time working on ongoing projects and independent research. It's not school, it's an early career stage.","The unfortunate truth is that once one of you fucks up, the rest of you are now representing that same idealogy. I hope you and your pos strikers all get run over.",,
57,,"I think this is mostly accurate but in some ways misleading.  Overall I support the idea of grad students being paid more, but not necessarily in the way that this strike seems to be advocating.  In some ways what I support is even more radical (see end of my comment for what I mean).

The main misleading thing is the bit about work hours.  In my experience as a grad student, I never felt myself pressured to work more than the number of ""on paper"" hours I was supposed to on an ongoing basis.  It's true that sometimes I wound up working slightly more hours at ""crunch time"" (like when exams had to be graded), but that would even out with lighter loads at other times.  Overall, I think I worked somewhat fewer hours than I was ""supposed"" to based on the hours in the contract.

I was not in a STEM field, so this could be different in different departments.  However, if others are being pressured to exceed their legally allotted work hours, then that is a separate matter from whether the wage exceeds the cost of living.  Even if the wage were raised to $100k, it would still be wrong for professors to pressure anyone to work more than they are required to.

Second, grad students typically get their fees (aka tuition) paid in addition to the actual salary.  We can argue about whether this is also just an on-paper fiction, but the fact is that if you are a grad student without financial support you wouldn't make zero dollars, you would make *negative* dollars because you would have to pay to go to school.  If the tuition that you don't have to pay is factored into these numbers, the picture begins to look quite different.

Most importantly, I think it is highly misleading to talk about ""only working 40 hours"" and roll in the student's own research activities as part of that.  Doing research is what grad students are going to school for, and what they would be paying tuition for if not for the fee exemption.  The payment a grad student TA receives is a payment for their work as a TA; the payment a graduate student researcher receives is a payment for their work on someone else's (i.e., a faculty member's) research project.  It is not a payment for doing the work toward getting your degree.  It is true that, on some level, everything you do as a grad student helps you toward your degree, but I don't think it's reasonable to conclude that therefore grad students should be paid for every hour of time they spend on anything related to academia.  Saying that TA salaries should reflect the work a grad student does to get their own degree is akin to saying that undergrads should be paid for doing their homework.

Now, all that said, let me flip it by saying that, on a broader level I agree with you.  And that broader level is this: the system is entirely screwed up.  But its screwed-up nature goes way beyond UCSB, or UC.  Academia as a whole is screwed up!  The details of how money flows in and out of research universities (like UCSB) are always going to be insane, because a large research university is essentially two operations --- a research institute and an educational endeavor --- that are smashed together and trying to maintain the illusion that they are one and the same.  As long we try to pretend that students paying tuition are ""paying for an education"" when in fact they are also paying for all the research that goes on at their school, which is also being paid for by research grants unconnected to any educational work, it won't make any sense to try to ""balance the books"" by comparing how much many anyone makes with what they actually do.

But the problem is even bigger than that.  The real problem (and this is kind of a duh thing) is just that it's too expensive to live here relative to how much money you can make --- and this is true for tons of people, not just the ones who are part of this strike.  Suppose the union got everything they wanted and grad student TA salaries went up to $54k.  There would still be waiters, grocery store cashiers, gardeners, teachers, artists, poets, and tons of other people who won't be making $54k and still won't be able to afford living in Santa Barbara (or many other places in coastal California).  I for one would like *all* those people to be able to afford to live here, not just grad students.

So I think the more radical option is to recognize that UC is not really the problem here; they are just one small part of a much larger problem.  The solutions to that are large-scale societal reforms like wealth taxes, an overhaul of Prop 13, a firehose of new housing construction etc.  So yeah, I support UC academic workers making more money, but I'm not sure I support giving *only* UC academic workers more money and just leaving a bunch of other people out in the cold.

(As one small example of how the problem reaches beyond UC, take a look at the [salaries for teaching assistants at Stanford](https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral-handbook/financial-support/student-pay).  A 50%-time TA makes about $12.5k per quarter, which comes out to about $38k over the academic year.  If TAs at Stanford are making less than what TAs at UC are asking for, I am skeptical that UC is the source of the problem.  Again, that's to say nothing of the salaries of people who work ordinary jobs unrelated to education and still can't afford to live here.)",,"1. The % increase you quote is only for the lowest-paid grad workers. The median increase would be more like 60%.
2. Ever bargained for something before? Maybe sold something OBO on Cragslist or OfferUp? ""Start high, then come down"" or the reverse is a pretty standard tactic.
3. Re: #2, the current number on the table is now 43k. Re: #1, 20-30%. In other words, not much more than a few years of inflation.
4. Taking CoL into account, especially with regard to housing, the resulting real salaries will still probably be less than they were 10 years ago.
5. Few, I assume, ever expected UC to agree to the demands in full. They didn't even come to the bargaining table before this fall.
6. Increasing certain workers' salaries but not others was a contract violation because it is a classic strike-breaking technique.

1.  Not correct - grad students take classes until they pass general exams.  This could be up to 3 years of coursework.

2.  These are generally accurate numbers but lots and lots of variation, including summer funding, outside funding, etc.

3.  TAs are restricted to 20 hours a week and any faculty member that pushes TAs past that number are penalized.  TAs that I know spend 2 hours a week in lecture, 3 hours a week in sections, 3 hours in office hours, and the rest is prep which is less than 5 hours.  This is just wrong.

4.  Why does this matter?  You are paid for 20 hours a week; the rest is up to the individual student, and their individual workloads.  And it varies based on where they are in the program and individual choices.

5.  And this - THIS - is the sticking point that you still can't explain.  Its based on single family households.  That means they are expecting a two income home.  So the 54k is the bottom end of two employed individuals living in the same place.  But I'm not positive this is how they came up with the number - the union is unclear about it - but that is the number consistent for California single family households.

6. And currently the labor for a 20 hour per week TA is valued at ---  roughly 54k per year (if you take the 24k paid over 9 months and extend it to a full time, 40 hour per week contract over 12 months).  TAs are already paid that amount.

2. It's not just Sb, other UC campuses are also experiencing the same crisis, and while housing is the crux of the issue, it's also about costs of food and transportation amidst rapid inflation. The 54k number was calculated as the min. number to get every UC out of rent burden. Also the santa barbara living wage right now is 52k-- it's not an unreasonable demand in context. stipends are meant to provide money to survive off of in grad school, so enough to live off of. a living wage! Also the housing crisis is also created by the UC buying up property by its universities and raising rent over market prices, making the closest housing to campus the most expensive on purpose. I would rex commend googling this as it's quite shocking. 


I also don't think most of us expect to get the 54k. Bargain high to meet in the middle. Hopefully we can get an offer quickly so undergrads can continue their education. and hopefully a good offer so that a strike doesn't have to happen again anytime soon.

I'm glad to hear it! Few of my peers have had a similar experience.

&#x200B;

>if others are being pressured to exceed their legally allotted work hours, then that is a separate matter from whether the wage exceeds the cost of living.

The union is [demanding many things](https://www.fairucnow.org); a salary increase is only one of them. Workload and bullying protections for grad researchers (which currently don't exist) are another.

&#x200B;

>We can argue about whether this is also just an on-paper fiction, but the fact is that if you are a grad student without financial support you wouldn't make zero dollars, you would make negative dollars because you would have to pay to go to school.

Perhaps things worked very differently in your program, but in STEM, once you've finished your coursework (typically in the first year) the ""tuition"" **is** an ""on-paper fiction"". We don't take classes or use the educational support resources that tuition money is ostensibly paying for.

I'm curious: were you a Master's student? When I was doing my Master's, I definitely felt like teaching was a pretty sweet deal because my tuition was covered *and* I got paid! In hindsight, though, I realize that in the second year of my Master's I was just doing research work for my PI for free.

&#x200B;

>it is highly misleading to talk about ""only working 40 hours"" and roll in the student's own research activities as part of that. Doing research is what grad students are going to school for, and what they would be paying tuition for if not for the fee exemption.

Grad workers *do*, in fact, get paid for doing research work (see #2 in the original post). Some never actually TA, or only TA for the one or two quarters required by their program. A 5th or 6th year PhD working full-time as a GSR is just as experienced and qualified as a 1st year postdoc (if not more so), but gets paid about half as much.

Grad research is typically published, and those publications bring in grant money for the PI and the university. In other words, that research work generates profit. An appropriate metaphor would be if GM charged auto workers for the pleasure of working in the production facility because they're learning how to make cars.

&#x200B;

>Academia as a whole is screwed up!

You're preaching to the choir! To synthesize the points that you touched on, we are dealing with the remnants of a Medieval-era system of apprenticeship. Higher education, academia, and research, and the broader economic and sociopolitical models in which they operate have changed massively since then. It's time to stop thinking of grad teachers and researchers as apprentices, and start recognizing that they are early-career employees.",,"I agree but it’s publically funded and I don’t think people realize the money has to come from somewhere they can’t just create money for this.

72,,"1) 'Up to three years' is also very vague. And you're failing to define what a class is. In many departments classes taken the first two years are primarily 'general studies' which involve my PI overseeing my work on their instruments. Traditional classes with a syllabus and exams are required, but rarely are 3-4 required every quarter for multiple years. More likely seminar are required as a class alongside the 'TA class' for 3 credits if you TA. It is extremely rare for grad students to have to take three full year of coursework with essays and exams. But lets pretend it is, and then what? What about the years after you pass comps/general exams when you stop taking classes and just do research and still have to pay 'tuition' for 'classes'?  How is that justified?

  
2) Sure. 

  
3) You are restricted to work 20 hours a week. But it is your job to know the course material if you are teaching. As a TA you rarely get to choose which class you are teaching. In larger departments (i.e. MCDB), you are guaranteed to teach course material unrelated your research and it is your job to learn the material that you then have to teach. Factor that in as well as you are well over 20 hours a week. And if you work for a professor who requires additional work over 20 hours a week, what then? Report them to the chair, dean, union, academic senate? What is the penalty? The professor, if tenured, gets a stern talking to and you are the grad student have to hope you didn't anger the wrong people who will refuse to give you TAships later in your grad school career. So if, IF you get an easier course/course you have taught before or that encompasses course material you are familiar with then yes you will work 20 hours a week. Never scoff at TA work, it is rarely as easy as you are making it out to be. 

  
4) Pretty sure if you don't do your research you will get kicked out of grad school so that work is also relevant and part of your job description as a graduate student even if it is unpaid labor. What if elementary and high school teachers didn't grade because they weren't directly paid for those hours, would they stay as teachers? Also, the University is an R1 research institute because of the research being conducted. Who conducts the research? Who conceptualizes and carries out the experiments? Grad students. Graduate research is the foundation of why UC's are a desirable place for undergraduates, why they actually make money.  Yet, we get paid 24,000 a year for only the work conducted as a TA. Do we get paid for this research that allows the UC to be an R1? Absolutely not. Do we in fact have to pay the UC to conduct research? Astoundingly yes. Graduate students and PI's have to apply for grants and fellowships to buy the equipment and conduct the research, the school doesn't provide that money. And on top of that, when a grant is received UCSB takes 45% of it. If your PI or lab receives a grant for 500,000, UCSB takes 225,000 and you only receive 275,000. If you apply for a NSF doctoral grant which are \~40,000, the school takes \~20,000.  So not only are graduate students not paid for their research, from our grants we pay the University to buy equipment and conduct experiments. And of course all equipment bought with the grant you received is owned by the University and cannot be taken when you move institutions.   

  
5) When you bargain, you start with a high number. This is essentially bargaining 101. 

  
6) TA salary is \~47,000 divided by 2 (part time) to get the 23,000. There are no paychecks over the summer. If you are suggesting that we extend the \~2,500 per month pay check over the summer months as well, that's an excellent starting plan. FYI 47,000 is in fact one of the the lowest starting salaries at UCSB. Custodial staff ( who are also extremely important!) start at \~53,000-55,000 a year.

  
7) ? Just calling out administers that make at least 15x more than grad students. Have you seen the yearly pay increases many of the deans and assistant deans received in the past couple years? It's a hell of a lot more than the 7% and 3% they are offering graduate students. 

  
8) You can find the breakdown of the budget online, but I suppose this disagreement comes down to how you define what is relevant to 'teaching'. 

  
9) You have to start somewhere. Grad students are being affected so they are the ones trying to force people with the power to make changes. Do you suggest graduate students should have instead waited for UC administration and elected officials to come together to find a more equitable distribution for tuition money and UC funding? 

  
10) Regardless of what you believe the solution, the privatization of UC is anger-inducing. 

  
11) Talk to someone on the picketline rather than reading posts on reddit.",,"This is why strikers want COLA - if wages are tied to the cost of living, the UC can't jack up rents to compensate 👌","""hey well guess what idiot, you can release the grades at any time too.""

73,,"As I stated, I'm not with the union.

1. You are correct, depending on the program. However, for programs with more coursework, the grads are often also TAing and doing research more than 20 hours/week concurrent with their coursework. And beyond the 3rd year, which could be 2-5 additional years, what I said is true.
2. This is what I said.
3. This is generally true for TAs (because they have had a union contract for years now!) but abuses do occur and are usually unpunished. I speak from first and second-hand anecdotal evidence, n>10. This is not true for grad researchers, who have no contract and hence no workload limits. And in the scenario you describe -- a TA working 13 hours/week -- 30+ hours/week would typically be spent on research work.
4. As I stated, we get paid for 20 hours/week *on paper* due to legal limits. A 50% GSR who only works 20 hours/week in the lab will soon find that their advisor isn't so keen to provide GSR funding anymore, and that they will need to start TAing. A 50% TA who works 20 hours/week teaching and 0 hours/week in the lab will soon find that they're no longer a member of the lab.
5. Pick whatever number you're comfortable with that lifts a median single individual renting a bedroom in a shared apartment in Santa Barbara out of rent burden. You'll find it much closer to $54k than the current average.
6. See #4.
7. I'm unaware of UC administrator unions, but on the whole, insisting that grad workers be responsible for diving into the UC budget -- which is larger than 20+ states in the US -- and indicate exactly which line items to cut is a straw man argument. That the UC is extremely wasteful with its spending is well documented -- I provided several links in the post -- and doesn't merit further debate.
8. It is hand-waving to assume that the way things are is the way they ought to be. As recently as the 1970s, tuition was far lower and the proportion of it that went directly to educators was far higher; assuming that is no longer possible requires supporting evidence.
9. We agree completely. My intent was to highlight that none of this happens in a bubble. These conflicts over the distribution of resources in public higher education will continue until priorities change from the top down and the inside out.
10. Obviously this is my opinion. Feel however you'd like.
11. Whether tuition increases is up to the Regents and the state. There is no question that the public doesn't have enough oversight of the Regents, but via elected officials we can, in fact, tell the UC to fuck off and cut spending instead of raising tuition. [This happened most recently in 2015.](https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Napolitano-Jerry-Brown-strike-deal-on-UC-tuition-6263588.php) And, as you hinted before, the ultimate solution will be political: increased or complete state funding to cover tuition.

What does it mean to say, “sure, ableism and anti-Blackness…but still labor under those conditions, because you obviously just should”?

But also you need to keep working.” It’s funny that there’s a whole TA strike in recognition of the terrible conditions under which TAs have to labor, and undergrads are showing up in droves in solidarity, even though many still need their grades to get their financial aid. But, that’s somehow a legitimate sacrifice for a greater ethical cause (TAs shouldn’t have to labor under terrible, explorative conditions so are absolutely right to withhold their labor). Mind you, there are also plenty of TAs who have also said the exploitation isn’t that bad (or doesn’t exist), they knew what they were signing up for, etc., but people have been — rightfully so — quick to critique them. Get some people of color to disagree with claims of racism, and suddenly hers don’t have merit. So when the disabled Black woman IVP withholds labor it in order to leverage for justice/redress for the anti-Black conditions that structure her existence on this campus, she should just not and do her job or we should dismiss those claims because well some other people of color have said that’s not what’s happening.

That was the part of the original post that got my hackles up most, yes, and I appreciate the discussion.  I'm going to keep most of my comments focused on the university funding and staffing side of our debate, mostly because I have done the most research in that area, and I feel comfortable discussing that issue.

> If you feel that each and every task you encounter in your work is essential to the education and research mission of the university, that's awesome and I applaud you.

This is a high bar, but my experience has generally been nearly all of the work I see done on the Academic side of the house does directly support and is essential to the mission of the university. Some work is important at a remove, of course.  As an example. I think we need a campus lab safety officer to ensure that we don't have accidents in labs, but success in that position means zero accidents, which is not necessarily in direct support of the mission.  

> Many of the people in these jobs do not believe that their job is important.

The Chronicle article is really interesting.  I haven't seen that effect from where I am, and a lot of the BS jobs they refer to are actually held by Faculty, not staff, but I can guess that they may exist in other parts of campus.  I know very little about workloads and impact in Student Affairs, Administrative Services, or Institutional Advancement.

> Going back to the earliest data this source has, 1976, the equivalent categories ""Administration"" and ""Student Services"" combine for $2,248 in 1992 dollars, or $4,765 in 2022 dollars. Again, about double, which corroborates point #2 in this comment and my sources from earlier.

This is the bit I have the most trouble with.  I think the overall increase in expenditure by universities is a good thing.  It shows that we are investing in our institutions of higher education, that we are providing more and better services than we did in 1976.  Our student bodies are vastly more diverse than they were in 1976, and our students are better supported in their studies, whether that's through tutoring, mental and physical health care, disability support, cultural support, and financial aid.  The academic enterprise itself is larger, and more complicated, with new departments such as Materials Engineering, Data Science, Feminist Studies, and Film & Media Studies.  I see all these things as good things, but they do cause an increase in the cost of the enterprise.  

So expenditures have doubled.  However, as a proxy, real US GDP per capita has also roughly doubled over that same time.  That seems like a sign that our universities are growing at roughly the rate they should, not that we should be cutting back to a level of investment not seen in 45 years.

> The question at hand is whether grad workers ought to be compensated for their labor with a living wage.

All employees deserve a living wage.  There's an interesting question about the working hours of grad students and researchers, but I don't want to get into those details here.  I don't have the expertise to evaluate the claims of both sides.  And despite that, I think there is a more useful way to look at it, which is this:

The university made a non-binding promise to most graduate students when they enrolled which went something like this: ""Come get your graduate degree here.  We will provide sufficient support over the 6-10 years through salary, tuition waivers and housing such that you won't have to take out a bunch of loans to get your PhD.""  That promise has broken down in the face of inflation, particularly in housing costs.  Something needs to be done to fix it, through a combination of increased salaries, some form of specific housing support, and building more dorms and university apartments.  Some of those solutions will take time, and there is a clear problem now.  I don't know how to square this circle, and I hope the university and the unions can come to an agreement to resolve this and the other issues that we haven't really touched on.",,"I’ve been told differently, like in the email I just quoted, as well as directly by graduate students who in their contracts directly state they will not jeopardize our education for the strike.

Henry's increase was the largest of the bunch, and was out of a total increase of $800,000:

I can do math too.  If you include the raises of all the chancellors, you also have to include the grad students at all the UCs, not just UCSB.  That's 26,000 grad students, so $800k/26k = $30/yr per grad student.  No help there.

> and many many vice chancellors who got huge salary increases

Do you have any sources for this?  Some vice chancellors are also still running active research labs and bringing in research dollars and teaching students.  Their increases could be related to that work, not their administrative work.  

If you wanted to do primary source research, the annual pay of every person at UC is available at the site below.  You can even search by title, like ""Vice Chanc"":

https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/",,"I think you’re missing how the strike works. Students can go to class all they want, but if they DO NOT HAVE GRADES SINCE THAT LABOR IS BEING STRUCK, no grades can be entered, and all faculty they are actively asking to engage in a sympathy strike in solidarity with the strikers would ALSO BE WITHHOLDING ALL THEIR LABOR, so it’s not about just what students are doing. It’s about the labor disruption that absolutely DOES impact students (even negatively), and the ASK is that students make that sacrifice in solidarity, too, because it’s worth it. 

Also, to name a Black student as “the system” is just a wild misunderstanding of how power works and how anti-Blackness functions. She is the thing that is oppressing her? How does that work?",">What happened to the strike not effecting the undergrads lmao?

85,,"> Perhaps things worked very differently in your program, but in STEM, once you've finished your coursework (typically in the first year) the ""tuition"" is an ""on-paper fiction"". We don't take classes or use the educational support resources that tuition money is ostensibly paying for.

Well, in my program classes lasted longer than that.  But still, what I was saying later in my comment about the muddled nature of research applies.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""educational support resources"", but I think there's a case to be made that if you are using anything at the school (a lab, an office, computers, the library), those are resources that are made available to students in exchange for tuition.  Or, more generally, if you take it as a baseline model that students pay to go to a school and get a degree from that school, then all that you do towards getting your degree is essentially what you pay for with your tuition.  In short, you are paying simply to be in school.

> I'm curious: were you a Master's student? When I was doing my Master's, I definitely felt like teaching was a pretty sweet deal because my tuition was covered and I got paid! In hindsight, though, I realize that in the second year of my Master's I was just doing research work for my PI for free.

No, I was a PhD student (well, MA/PhD combined program, but the MA was just a formality along the way).  I had a combination of TAships and fellowships at different points during my grad school career.

> Grad workers do, in fact, get paid for doing research work (see #2 in the original post). Some never actually TA, or only TA for the one or two quarters required by their program. A 5th or 6th year PhD working full-time as a GSR is just as experienced and qualified as a 1st year postdoc (if not more so), but gets paid about half as much.

Again I think the way this works differs in different fields.  But the essential point I was making is that there is (at least in principle) a difference between a grad student doing *their* research to get *their own* degree and a grad student doing research as labor for someone else.

I know that this distinction can be almost invisible in STEM fields where you are sort of attached to a PI's project and write a dissertation based on that rather than doing a project that is wholly your own.  But that's not the case in all fields.  In any case, it is the same basic point: I don't think it's unreasonable to say that grad students should pay (not be paid) for going to school and getting a degree.  A degree has value, so it makes sense to say that people should pay for it.  (Or at least, that is the accepted model of how education works in the US.)  If as part of that they do work that benefits someone else, that's cool, but it then makes sense for any pay to be offset against the benefit the student receives in the form of their own degree.  So it is not just about ""being paid to do research""; it matters whether the time you're spending is for your own benefit (to get your degree) or someone else's, or (if both are intertwined) how the benefit is distributed.

> Grad research is typically published, and those publications bring in grant money for the PI and the university. In other words, that research work generates profit. An appropriate metaphor would be if GM charged auto workers for the pleasure of working in the production facility because they're learning how to make cars.

Again, that varies by field.  Whether your metaphor is apt depends on the relative value of the knowledge gained by the student-autoworker versus the money made by the factory.  Maybe more importantly, though, if GM started doing that, no one would work there.  So if a grad student considers the UC a factory charging them to work there, maybe the student should reconsider whether grad school is a good use of their time.  (I don't mean this as a snide comment; I think there are a fair number of people who pursue a PhD out of a somewhat romanticized notion of scholarship when really their mental health and financial stability would be better if they just did something else.)  In the long run I think this kind of ""strike"" (fewer people entering grad school because to do so is irrational on various objective measures) could be what shakes the foundations of the academic system so much that more pervasive change begins.

> It's time to stop thinking of grad teachers and researchers as apprentices, and start recognizing that they are early-career employees.

Well, I'd say it's a bit more broad than that.  For one thing, when we think in terms of the work that is being done by TAs, we also need to think about those in the middle between them and ladder faculty, namely the non-tenure-track faculty (adjuncts, lecturers, etc.).  As we see more and more in the news these days, that's also a group that often gets the shaft, even though no one disputes that they are employees.  So it's more like ""are we creating a situation where people have to be almost insane to do a thing"" (whether that be enrolling in grad school or applying for an adjunct job).

But to go back to the issue of grad student research: in humanities fields, for instance, a grad student may spend a bunch of time reading various texts and writing a dissertation in which they analyze them.  Probably they cite their advisor a lot, but it's not like they're directly doing work ""for"" the advisor, or doing work on a larger project or producing one in a series of publications coming out of a lab with a unified research program.  They genuinely are doing *their own* research, and the advisor is genuinely an advisor, not the manager of an ongoing project to which the student (along with their research) is attached.

There is undoubtedly a penumbra of benefit that accrues to the department from this, in the sense that if that student gets a job and becomes a respected scholar, the department's own reputation is enhanced.  But I think in this sort of situation it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the department (or the advisor, or the school) ""profited"" in any direct monetary sense from the student's research.

Of course, the danger with this line of thinking is that it leads to the problems we already have in some places, with humanities programs being defunded because they ""have no practical value"" or the like.  That's why I think we need to think a bit more broadly than just ""the student is an employee doing work that brings profit to the school/PI/department"".  More like ""the student is a researcher and by their research they expand the total of human knowledge and that's a good thing for humanity so we should pay them for that"".

And in a sense that *is* pay for labor --- it's the same labor that tenured faculty members get paid for!  But I think it would be good to just squarely face the issue and say ""yes we want to pay people to go to school"", because trying to frame it in terms of labor will introduce these discrepancies between different fields based on the perceived monetary value of their practical applications, and lead to all sorts of worrisome complications.  In other words, maybe we should forget everything that I said above about distinguishing the student's research for their own benefit from their work for their advisor's benefit, and just say we're going to flip the script and have grad school in general be something you get paid to do rather than something you pay for.  (Although if we do that, I think it would also require a major overhaul of the way duties like TAing get assigned.)

Or, of course, more generally, we should maybe be saying ""Yes, we want people to be able to live a nice life in California, regardless of whether they are a grad student or a gardener.""  And try to address that issue (although it is much more daunting).",,"It’s really simply not true that this won’t impact financial aid, especially depending on the source of financial aid. It will also directly impact student athletes. While I certainly support the strike, I do not support misinformation, as well intentioned as it may be. Yes, the University uses all kinds of strike-busting tactics. But it’s genuinely the case that it will have impacts. If not, why would the university have to develop CONTINGENCY plans? If it was never the case that it would impact financial aid, no contingency plan would be necessary. But, the EVC (higher rank than the Interim AVC) is clearly reaching out to faculty to actively encourage them to determine which students would be impacted and give them grades (the same way they did during the wildcat strike).","respectfully, not a single protest or labor movement in American history has been successful without at least mildly inconveniencing innocent bystanders. MOST of them have been successful only through violent means -- compare something like the women's march (largest protest in U.S. history but peaceful and ineffective) to the civil rights movement (radical and often violent, quickly causing massive change).

disruption is an essential part to change. if you seriously thought this strike would have zero consequences on your life as a student, you were delusional. luckily, most students realize that mild and temporary disruption to their academic life, as serious as it can feel, is negligible to our peers fighting for their right to afford food and housing. these students also realize that these disruptive actions are essential to winning leverage in negotiations -- the UC does not want a pissed student body. so we have no issue tolerating them for the betterment of our peers.",,
86,,"> Pretty sure if you don't do your research you will get kicked out of grad school so that work is also relevant and part of your job description as a graduate student even if it is unpaid labor.

I wrote a longer comment elsewhere, but I just want to say that this reasoning doesn't really make sense.  If an undergrad doesn't take their exams, they will get kicked out of college, but that doesn't mean they should therefore be paid for taking exams.

Being a grad student is not, in itself, a paying job.  If someone goes to grad school to get a degree, that doesn't mean that they should be paid just for doing what they need to do to get that degree.  In fact, on the undergrad level (and on the grad level in some situations), it's exactly the opposite: the student pays to go to school.  It's true that the boundary between job and student roles is somewhat less clear-cut for many grad students, but it's unreasonable to suggest that everything a grad student does is part of a ""job"" and therefore should be reflected in their salary.  They get paid for work they do *for the school* (or for someone else, like a professor), not for themselves.",,"Again. Instructor error. Talk to a graduate student. Or an instructor.

The problem is that our stipends do not match the cost of living and do not catch up with the cost of inflation.

This is the thing that I think throws people off. At UCs, the TAship is considered a ""salaried"" appointment that is separate from one's research (things get muddied with RAships though.) There's this separation of labor on the part of the university between work as a TA and everything else you do as a student, which is not how it's done in some other places where you just get a stipend and that's just seen as what you get to live in the program on generally. 

The thing I see often left out is that we do (all?) receive at least a little block grant money every year that is an actual stipend, but it's not much (amount obviously varies by department.) Some folks have central fellowships but the stipends on those are only 30k per year (but if you teach on top of that then you make like 55k per year- so these rare folks are basically the only ones here that make that much currently.) I wonder if what will wind up being negotiated is an increase in salary and also some sort of increase to block grant budgets so that students receive more actual stipend money that is separate from employment.

Dear all,

I have been very conflicted over how to proceed with the strike as I want to both support our graduate students (who are grossly underpaid) as well as the undergraduates (who are paying for the class they are taking). I was hoping the strike would resolve, but it hasn't.

So, here is my plan going forward:

1. To avoid physically crossing the picket line, I am going to record videos for my last lectures (including the one the week before Thanksgiving). I will hold office hours during our normal class time via zoom on Friday. I know this might seem like not as rigorous as actually having class, but I feel guilty about holding a three hour in person class when so many of my colleagues are actively striking. Recorded lectures and office hours seems to me less like I am actually going against the strikers and rather just trying to support the undergrads. If the strike ends before Friday we will meet in person (look for an email from me in that case). 

The reason I have not simply cancelled class is that I do want to offer those of you who need it a chance to improve your grade with a final.

2. The final will be optional and take home.

Unfortunately, I cannot tell you where you stand in the class before the final because I do not have full grades for your midterm or second paper. In this class, a graduate student grades about 100 of the midterms/papers each time something is due and I grade the rest. The grader is part of the strike and so will not grade or release grades until the strike is over.

If you are concerned about your grade at all, I advise you to take the final. It will have the same format as the midterm, with targeted questions being geared to the lectures that I have recorded or will record (on Newton, Hooke, Boyle, and the Royal Society). It will be open book and open notes, like the midterm.

In summary, here is the remaining to do list for this class:

1. Watch video lectures (to be posted soon).

2. Come to office hours (Thursday 9-10, F 10-12 and again 1-1:45, all on zoom).  

3. If you want to raise your grade, take final exam. I will post it on 12/5 (next Monday) and it will be due by 12/8 (the following Thursday). 

I hope that is helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments

Some of those solutions will take time, and there is a clear problem now. I don't know how to square this circle, and I hope the university and the unions can come to an agreement to resolve this and the other issues that we haven't really touched on.

Well said! If UC could simply provide at-cost or state-subsidized housing for every grad worker, many grad workers' current salaries might suffice.

You always mention that you can do the math. But You always use some/and other vague words. One also counts toward 'some' but that is not how math works. Here the main point is not what they did. they should not receive a salary increase that is way higher than **any other type of worker** (including lecturers and TA/RA). Especially when they already earned a lot of money.

 The academic-to-non-academic staff ratio is unacceptable for a research university like UC. According to UC's data, only 38% of the total salary goes to Academic employees' pockets.  Instructional supporting staff's total salary is 6 times TA's salary. (INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTING ONLY, No housing/cleaning people, etc.) TA's salary is only 5% of the entire instruction expenditure. However, the instruction  
expenditure is less than 15% of the entire UC revenue. That's scary.

This statement is overall hyperbolic. Even mentioning a general labor strike in the same thread with the civil rights movement is crass.

Generally, in STEM, grad researchers use a lab and office in a research building. Those facilities are supported by grants, not by tuition. TAs either use their lab office or a shared TA office, which is supported by their students' tuition. Generally the only services we use that are supported by tuition are GSA activities, which cost on the order of a hundred dollars per student per quarter, not thousands.

Agreed.  I still don't understand why or how you think the university could cut half its current staff and still function as/at the same level it currently does, but I do agree that the staff need a living wage just as much as the grad students do, and that historically the university has paid less than market wages to most staff.",,,"Yeah, but professors don't get communications directly from the union or student affairs.

Okay, but I feel like that is a massive issue to just gloss over.  It turns the entire question from one of pay-for-labor into one more akin to conflict-of-interest, because the system is set up so that if you're motivated to bust your butt to help your career prospects in the long run, the only way to do that is to help someone else's career in the short run.  Independent of how much anyone is paid, that to me seems like an issue in itself.

All of what you say makes sense, but I think it's becoming increasingly clear that it's very specific to STEM fields.  (And likely not even to all STEM fields.  I'm pretty sure math, for instance, can be quite different.)

I realize you had the disclaimer in your post that you're only speaking about STEM experience, but you also disclaimed any connection to the union and we can see in other comments that some people didn't read that either.  :-)  I think a casual reader of your post is likely to come away with a view like ""wow, grad students *in general* work 40 hours a week to profit the university and get paid almost nothing"" and I think that is inaccurate.

101,,"It's not accurate to phrase it as ""paying people to go to school,"" as you have somehow managed to do four times in a short paragraph. It's paying grad students for both their teaching and their research (as we already do for faculty). As mentioned by OP, most grads only take courses for a year or two, so that sort of ""going to school"" is a pretty small part of being a grad student. Instead, most of your time is directed toward conducting research, presenting your research at conferences, publishing your research in journals, and submitting it in your dissertation (which, for the humanities, you later work into a larger monograph). We don't get paid to do any of this work, and it is quite literally what moves our respective research areas forward.",,,"your company opting to pay more for temporary workers instead of casting the burden of the strike onto customers (the would-be inconvenienced bystanders in this case) is a really, really good example of how powerful even the threat of disruption is in strikes. your company was willing to take a temporary hit in profits in order to prevent a disastrous loss of trust (read: revenue) in their customer base. the UC has more leverage before they begin to feel their own revenue at risk (students cannot so easily pull out their money as opposed to most other customers), which means they are willing to inconvenience their customers more, and so disruptions necessarily must be more extreme.

not hyperbolic. the United States has a centuries-old democratic culture where movements that prioritize nonviolent, nondisruptive purity testing over effecting change by force have fallen flat time and time again even with record-breaking popular support and participation. the civil rights movement and the womens march are just popular examples of this juxtaposition, crass or not.",,

The truth is changing your mind needs time not evidence so basically, I would not expect you to change your mind. However, the only thing you need to know is the percentage and ratio matter. By applying statistical models, for example, the student-teacher ratio, you will notice we are short of academic personnel. 

If UC needs to choose between staff and academic researchers, as a public research university, they must choose academic researchers. However, this time UC only needs 1%-3% of its budget to fulfill more than 70% of academic employees' demand. Basically, UC does not need to choose between staff and academic researchers.

No one said UC needs to cut half of its staff. Do not exaggerate the number. When you do so, actually you know you are not correct. The non-student staff is about 1.5 to 2 times more compared to the graduate student. And their salary is 2-3 times higher than graduate students (Depending on which campus). So cutting half of its staff literally makes no sense. UC is paying graduate students 50%-100% lower salaries compare to Standford and Caltech. UC is paying a lower wage even compared to other public university systems while California has the highest housing price.

If students fail a class because they did not know how well or not they were doing, they will have to retake that class. Failing will impact their GPA, which will impact their eligibility potentially for financial aid, graduation status, and some scholarships. It might impact their standing as a student, particularly if on academic probation. If they fail enough classes, they technically might not have passed enough courses to be considered making satisfactory academic progress (SAP). As an ASE, I think it’s our obligation to adequately—and accurately—inform students. The messaging about grades from the strikers has all acted as if everyone will inevitably pass when assignments are graded, which is not a fair (or true) assumption. Further, instructors submit grades, so this also prolongs the labor of instructors (faculty). 

And, it’s really a catch-22. Faculty should NOT be responding to student emails if they are sympathy striking, because they are, by definition, supposed to be withholding ALL of their labor not just grading. Otherwise, they are technically not protected by HEERA and can face consequences. So it’s unfair to say they don’t want to be held responsible to answering questions, because answering those questions quite literally means they are not legally protected. Lastly, the EVC (who outranks student affairs people and whose office is responsible for the “academic planning and programming, the development and implementation of academic policy, and the academic personnel process”) has been sending emails to faculty that contain the language this professor is referencing.

The question about professor emails is still predicated on an illogical argument. Withholding all labor means not checking work emails, so how would they know if an email is strike-related or not? FACULTY have different obligations than ASEs. ASEs checking emails is not taking up struck labor because all their work emails are not about ASE-related work.

Yes, but the problem we are facing is that the school you worked hard to get into, isn't working hard for the people that make it all possible. They are not working hard for you the student, they are not working hard for other undergrads, they are not working hard for the grads they under pay, they are not working hard for the professors who are now without TAs.

If you're paying so much and worked so hard, shouldn't this not even be a problem? It's the administration who has left everyone out to dry, and you're losing sympathy for the strike???

115,,"This is part of a growing global strike wave, everywhere workers and students need higher wages to combat sky high inflation. 

There are some [50,000 academic workers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/17/isum-n17.html) on strike in the US right now between the 48,000 UC grad students and over 1,600 part-time faculty members at The New School in New York City on Wednesday. 

""Last week, graduate student employees in Philadelphia voted by 99 percent to authorize the Temple University Graduate Students’ Association to call a strike by 750 student teaching and research assistants. The strike vote follows 10 months of “unproductive negotiations,” according to the union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers.

The rebellion of university workers is part of broader movement of the working class, which includes the six-month strike by 1,300 UAW members at construction and farm equipment manufacturer CNH Industrial plants in Wisconsin and Iowa and 250 UAW members at the Murdoch-owned publishing giant HarperCollins in New York City.  
  
In addition, [110,000 railroad workers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/16/pers-n16.html) and [22,000 West Coast dockworkers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/10/14/ggki-o14.html) are pressing for strike action to fight for improved wages and an end to exhausting and unsafe working conditions. Despite the best efforts by the rail unions and the Biden administration to block a railway strike, momentum is growing for the defeat of the White House-brokered contract and a walkout, which would immediately turn into a confrontation with Congress and both corporate-backed parties.   
  
This movement, moreover, is part of a broader international resurgence of class struggle, from the transit and refinery workers in France; metal workers in Germany; and railroad, health care and educational workers in the UK, where the new Tory government plans to release a brutal austerity plan today. In every case, workers are fighting demands for belt-tightening from capitalist governments that have found trillions for bank bailouts and the funding of the US/NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.    
  
In both The New School and University of California strikes, workers are in a direct battle with the UAW apparatus, which is aligned with the Democratic Party budget cutters. Behind the scenes, there is no doubt that top UAW officials are in discussions with California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom to shut down the strike as soon as possible. Newsom is an officer of the UC Board of Regents and, along with his Democratic predecessor Jerry Brown, appointed 16 of the 17 members of the body, which is leading the attack on university workers.  
  
The UAW has done nothing to inform, let alone mobilize its members behind the striking university workers, even though they make up more than 10 percent of the active UAW membership.

In opposition to the sabotage by the UAW bureaucracy, Mack Trucks worker and socialist candidate for [UAW president Will Lehman](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/) has issued a call for the full mobilization of UAW members and all workers behind the striking academic workers in the UC system and at The New School.   
  
“I welcome this powerful struggle by university workers. The issues that you are fighting for—wage increases to fight inflation and secure a good standard of living so you can afford to keep a roof over your heads, have good food and health care, and raise a family—are what all workers want.   
  
“Your battle can be won, but it will require mobilizing the broadest sections of the working class. First, this means forming rank-and-file strike committees to really empower yourselves. These committees should outline your own demands, including a 100 percent raise, COLA, fully paid health care and pensions, and the elimination of all fees. At the same time, these committees must oversee all negotiations, which must be live-streamed, and be prepared to countermand any efforts by the UAW bureaucracy to shut down the strike prematurely and impose a snap agreement.   
  
“Appeals to the big business Democrats are worse that worthless. You must take your struggle from the campus to the factories, the docks, the railyards and beyond to build a powerful counteroffensive of the working class against austerity, inequality and war.”",,,"you do not understand the amount of work your TAs are doing and how little money they make to live off. calling it a “bigger check” is very dismissive. theyre barely making enough money to live, and if you understood the work load they have to take on you would understand that they cant simply have another job on the side along with it, and many contracts flat out ban it. 

you having side jobs to afford undergraduate is not comparable to what they are doing. if anything, the impact this is having should make it glaringly obvious who is doing the work vs who is getting compensated. 

you are expecting your TAs to settle with the status quo of perpetual poverty and overwork for your short term comfort. 

every other person on this thread is trying to tell you that this will not impact your education in the long term, while the strike holding out has the potential to influence the lives of generations of grad students all across the UC system. 

if youre going to be angry, be angry at a system that is refusing to settle this issue faster. dont be mad at your TAs when you cant even begin to understand how much work they do and how difficult it is for them to live with poverty wages in an insanely expensive city.",,
116,,"Lol literally posting a union president campaign for some Bolshevik dude, that has very little to do with UCSB. Nice.",,,"I mean, the strike didn't start until Week 8. My students had the majority of their grades prior to the strike starting and could easily determine how they are doing in this class without my help. It sounds like you invest a lot into your students and your teaching, which is great, but this is a legal strike that you have a right to participate in to improve the working conditions of yourself and your colleagues. You are not beholdened to help your students during a strike. I know it's hard and can feel like you're abandoning them, but they would be ok without you. In the long run, a better contract will benefit undergraduates because their TAs across the board will not be rent burdened, won't have to take multiple jobs to make ends meet, etc. 

Also, I think the email thing is not that deep. Faculty have plenty of activities (research, service to the field, mentorship, public/nonprofit service, etc) that are not related to the graduate student strike that they may get emails about and wouldn't be considered picking up struck labor. The police don't come banging at your door because you read an email about teaching. It's not that deep. Totally fine if they don't wanna read emails, I'm not sure where your logic is going",,

Workers need to be warned, this lot will do everything they can to wind down the strike and then claim a victory for getting below inflation raises, and a $30 dollar bus pass!

While union bureaucrats went on and on about wrapping things up quickly, getting rid of COLA, the strike being at it's strongest before it actually starts, and other such nonsense, that was shouted down by workers not only in chat, but when they tried to close the meeting down after running out of bureaucrats.

It should be pointed out, that even so, there were a number of people that managed to speak with great eloquence and anger at the betrayal the UAW is preparing.

Oh, and you may want to check your right wing politics.  Most workers, and most students, oppose war, and are in no way in favor of the handing of billions of dollars to Ukraine or anything else that has to do with the ongoing drive towards World War 3.  In fact, I would wager that by the end of the school year, you will see mass demonstrations on campuses.  But then, suckling up to the Democrats and warmongering are pretty much a staple of union bureaucrats that like to negotiate sweetheart deals with management while collecting salaries in the hundreds of thousands for themselves and salaries of at least a hundred thouasand for their family members.",,,"I think you don’t understand that faculty participation in the strike CANNOT just be about withholding TEACHING related labor. It is that deep. They have to withhold ALL labor to be LEGALLY protected and not face consequences based on the faculty code of conduct (married to a professor and have read numerous HEERA related cases). Admin can absolutely decide to hold partially striking faculty accountable, and those who are targeted will likely be untenured faculty of color and/or women, in departments that are already hostile toward them. 

Grades are weighted in my class, so students who failed the midterm are failing the class but could still pass if they do well on the final (cumulative), but that requires 1) a classroom to cover the materials; 2) someone to teach them those materials; 3) an assessment tool to assess learning (the final); 4) someone to administer the final; and 5) someone to grade the final. None of that can be done retroactively. So while students might know where they stand, what if where they stand is failing, even if just by a few points? Sucks to be them? In STEM, which is notorious for pushing out women and people of color, especially women of color, this is likely to have a very real racial and gender disparate impact. But, no harm right? No. There will be harm. And it’s our responsibility to account for that harm, inform students of that harm, and let them make an informed decision, where they get to decide what they want to do—the same way we got to decide. All the rhetoric from strikers has been largely misleading or dismissive, and I’ve had problems with our union leadership and the lack of strategic consideration around marginalized communities since I have been here.

I know the UC has a budget to balance. Fun fact, the reason tuitions have increased so much in the past decade is NOT because of worker wages. Wages for a vast majority of UC employees has been near stagnant while tuition has consistently risen well above inflation. Everyone got a pay-freeze during the pandemic while tuition went up. Go talk to the UC about what the hell they're doing with all that extra money. A smaller fraction of tuition goes to pay teaching salaries than you might realize. This reminds me of when folks fought so hard not to increase salaries for minimum wage fast-food workers because then the food would be ""So MuCh MoRe ExPeNsIvE"" but then it turned out doubling worker salaries only increased prices by like 20 cents. The UC needs to fight to improve government subsidization of public education. And they can do that after they adjust salaries to a livable wage & have more motivation to lobby.

Do not blame grad students for rising tuition. We are absolutely not the cause. Hell, GSRs PAY tuition IN FULL AND our funding for our salary comes from OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. We're legitimately free labor for the UC with an extra side helping of $20k

And if you're looking for schools that now pay 40k and up to their grad students/TAs, here's some (these wages are a recent change because of COLAs since the pandemic): Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia. The grad students at all of these universities fought HARD for a COLA, and that momentum has spread to many other campuses as grad school becomes more unaffordable. We will not be the last grad students to fight for this.",,,"Why would they have to when the strikers are using tactics that are designed to tick off undergrads?

You’re right, it’s not GSRs that have caused tuition to rise, it’s, as I pointed out the near 65% drop in state funding that has caused tuition to rise and UC unable to keep up on grad school pay. 

THAT is what needs to be fixed it’s also what needs to be fixed first. The budget must balance. The union knows this, and it’s why they are suggesting a complete defunding of UCPD. It can’t go 1. Raises for grad students 2. Get funds. It absolutely has to go the other way (or reallocation, but who’s gonna volunteer for a pay cut)?

It’s right to call me jaded. Society far better values your brothers immediate productivity as a receptionist than our 50% doing research (on average). I don’t love it, but it is what it is. Other countries (Germany as an example), get this and have much better grad student standards of living.

Also, discounted classes at a UC?

A lot of students are getting paid through loans, grants or their parents and haven’t felt the financial crunch that grad students have. Add in the many grad students are older and have to worry about health insurance ontop of that. Not saying every undergrad doesn’t understand but many don’t until they get into the working world.

$54k a year in SB is not a lot but it’s living wage if you have roommates. I started my first job in SB at $45k. I was lucky that I didn’t need to worry about health insurance at the time. As I progressed in my career I realized I was salaried and I worked several hours over 40 unpaid every week. I was a STEM major doing work in consulting. In reality I was working 50-60 hours a week. My stress climbed, my mental health tanked and things got expensive once I was off my parents health insurance. Several years later I quit that job and get a new one that offered minimal paid overtime and paid what I thought was worth my skills. My mental health shot up.

What you eventually learn is that labor, regardless of how skilled, is labor. That labor you create is time and energy out of your life to make someone else money. It doesn’t matter if it’s looking at excel all day or standing infront of a cash register taking orders or bagging groceries. It all contributes to someone’s profit. In grad students they are paid poverty wages, do not often take classes (where is their “tuition” going then?), and work well beyond the 20 hours required on paper. They put in so much LABOR and they are not paid for it. They are benefiting their PIs and the school with their work and should be adequately compensated for it, recharges if they are STEM or not.",,
149,,"

My comment was on the union's claim that grad students work 40 hours instead of 20 when you take in account for research. This claim is absurd. The 20 hours of teaching is so that you can earn a stipend and whatever grad students do besides that benefits noone but them. 

You can twist my words here all you want. It's not going to achieve you anything as this is reddit, so better direct them to the admin. But the university already knows how ridiculous some of the union claims are.",,,"Lots of misinformation on this thread. 

1. Only professors can be principal investigators. They bring in the grant money. 

2. With grants, the PI’s create a budget when they apply for them. They build in the cost of the graduate employees at the start of the grant. Harvard and USC graduate employees cost more. Granting agencies are fine with this. It comes down to the quality of the project. They fund good projects according to what they need. 

3. The cost of increasing TA compensation can and should come from the state, which currently has a massive budget surplus. Those are complicated negotiations, but the money is there. UC is not a company. It does not have finite revenue like a company. If you want lower tuition, elect officials who want to see tuition lowered. They can make it happen. California is rich AF. (Same with housing. The university can issue bonds. They just don’t because of other pressures. Plus they sold us out for Munger bucks.)

4. No doubt delayed grades will cause stress. But entries of No Grade, NG, are not F’s. Grading deadlines are made up by the university. They can change them whenever they’d like. And they will if the strike continues because they don’t want the crisis that will result from their made up deadlines staying in place. 

Some other things:

Graduate student TAs work max twenty hours a week according to their contract. Other leading universities pay in the thirties of forties per year for the same work. If UC wants to continue attracting top students it needs to pay more. Striking is the only way to make that happen right now. The striking workers are doing UC a favor and to administrators know it. They have pressure coming from other forces like the Regents that they’re trying to balance. When all is said and done this strike will have helped prevent UC drop in the rankings. That’s good for undergrads, as is higher quality graduate students and thus TA instructors. 

No need to be divided. We’ll all be fine. Let the process work. Labor conflicts are a normal part of our capitalist economy. No new system on the horizon. Is what it is.",,
150,,"So, bringing in underqualified and untrained undergrads to carry along research that's already been dumped onto underpaid and overworked grad students by generally underpaid and overworked professors, combined with making those already overworked professors work even more, and a cute little scantron cherry on top is your solution to this issue? Never mind those undergrads would have to be trained by the folks you're so convinced are overpaid, or the fact that the grad students you're so convinced are being greedy/ridiculous are literally the single biggest thing BRINGING VALUE TO THE INSTITUTION AS A WHOLE. This is such a naive and frustrating sentiment because it's so incredibly reductive while also overcomplicating the shit out of the entire problem.

If you treat people well, they'll do good work and add value. Once you lose track of that everything starts crumbling. It's an overarching theme present in so many facets of American decline, but somehow people like you will keep screaming for efficiency all the while you bitch about the consequences of treating people like commodities. 

I bet you cry about how shitty your professors are out one side of your mouth while the other side is screaming about how little they care about undergrads actually learning.

The professors are also unionized and have a lot of power. They won't take that shit. 

At the end of the day, even if they pay us TAs all that we want, we are still half the cost of a professor.",,,"1.	⁠STEM (especially engineering GSRs) absolutely deserve more, not sure about TAs tho since they often do less TA work from my experience. Then again it is a more competitive major in terms of pay after graduation so therefore perhaps they should be paid a little more than Letters TAs just to correspond more with industry. Also the work load of engineering TAs varies greatly from my experience.
2.	⁠Well from my experience talking with them, engineering TAs often actually have an easier job. They typically just have to grade a couple of physics type problems whereas history TAs have to grade long ass papers and stuff. But engineering gets paid more in the real world so again I can’t decide about this. I know they already currently make more than L and S TAs tho.
3.	⁠In the long term yes, but not immediately.
4.	⁠Idk hasn’t affected me.

I am pretty against the strike for many reasons. I think most of all is just the ridiculous 54k for 20 hours. And no working on ur personal thesis shouldn’t count as work. That’s just some bs. The second reason is it seems there are a lot of communists/anarchists, at least among the most vocal strike ppl. Like they always have to add in radical and unrelated things about “Land Back F Cops” and even ppl with megaphones complaining about  “Neocolonialism” (AKA just flat-out hating America) and shit like that. Just look at abolishucsb on ig. I rly dislike those ideals. There are other reasons but those are the two main ones.",,
152,,"I agree that a drop in funding needs to change. At present, it will not change unless something initiates it. That decades long trend has been more than obvious. Putting costs before funds is HOW we motivate funding from the state level, though again I don't think you have internalized just how small the TA salary budget is in full tuition prices, it won't be enough to cause a massive UC financial crisis. The UC took a much greater financial hit during the pandemic from closed dorms. At the time they were projecting a massive financial loss but it ended up not being nearly as bad as expected for their budgets. The cost of even a substantial TA raise would be a much smaller disruption of the budget.

Just about everyone knows the complete defunding of the UCPD isn't going to happen, but seriously analyzing the size of the UCPD budget compared to the entire budget for paying TAs is an eye opener for the UC's financial priorities. 

And finally, my bro doesn't live in CA, several other universities now have better TA packages than UC than just rich Ivy's, including U of Wisconsin (one of the schools you applied to), and several universities that are located in much cheaper areas have comparable TA salaries without having the insane housing income from CA-priced dorms & university apartments (the UC makes SO MUCH MONEY from expensive undergrad housing). If they can make it work, so can the UC.

For the sake of my own happiness today, I'm going to disengage from this conversation. It does not provide me any way for me to actually address my current pressing financial or health issues, so I'm going to go to the picket line and fight for that myself. I wish you the best, and I hope you transfer your energy away from fighting for an institution that has repeatedly violated housing, environmental, and fair labor policies at both the city and state level for its own financial gain. They are not your friend.",,,"Some things to consider:

Students from underrepresented backgrounds (including first generation students, students with dependents, students with disabilities) are less likely to attend a university that has a low pay to cost of living ratio since many of these students are already struggling financially.

This is a false equivalence. As someone who has been a faculty member for decades, it’s absolutely ridiculous to suggest that TAs—or any graduate student—is doing anything comparable to a tenure-track faculty member’s job, let alone a full-time (underpaid) lecturer. 50% at 54k is higher than most full-time, tenure-track assistant Professor faculty salaries at 100% time (40 hours/week, except we know they work well over that). To imagine any TA does 50% of the work a full-time, tenure-track faculty does is bonkers and demonstrates true lack of understanding of senate faculty responsibilities. I’m all for ASEs getting a raise, but not based on these absurd claims. (Also speaking as someone who worked an ADDITIONAL job as a TA in the UCs). If TAs are being required to do more than 20hrs of work/week on average (not all work in one week totals 20hrs, let’s be real), that’s a labor exploitation issue for certain, and it should be addressed as certain. I have had dozens of TAs over the years, and the idea that they did over 20hrs/wk on average as a TA (the only position for which they are paid—you do lot get paid to do research, and the notion that graduate students are somehow the powerhouse of research outcomes is beyond ridiculous) is news to me any every colleague I’ve had, across 8 institutions.

159,,"I absolutely agree that TAs don’t do the work of faculty members. Graduate students don’t (except in a few specific cases) have the qualifications or knowledge to do tasks like curriculum design, hiring, or any of the hard work of running a department, and even if we did, it’d be just factually incorrect to say that we’re doing the job of professors. (I hope to get there someday, but I’m the first to say I’m not there yet.) I’m not trying to imply that and I really don’t want to come across that way. What I have a problem with is the constant characterization of grad students as 20 hour/week workers, because the dynamics at play in academia (at least in my field) basically guarantee that we work more than that.

I would say that, in my department, the labor exploitation of TAs by professors that you’re talking about absolutely happens — I do know several TAs who have been asked to do things like write exams, grade a lot of final projects on short notice due, turnaround grades unreasonably fast in time for exams, etc… and it can absolutely add up to more than 20 hours per week. I can’t know for sure, but I think the minority of professors who ask their TAs to do this kind of thing totally don’t realize they’re doing it — they just aren’t doing the math of adding up what everything they’ve asked for comes to. One professor I TAd for made a lot of last minute and abrupt course changes that came to a ton of extra work for me, and I think she just had too much on her plate to realize that. Of course it was totally an option to call out that labor violation by some formal mechanism, but due to the power dynamics at play I can’t imagine a situation where it would be the smart move unless that student didn’t care about their reputation and was probably already planning on leaving their program or academia in general. When I was in that situation, I just put up with the labor violation, took on more than I could handle, and avoided causing a fuss. As a result, that professor is now a great reference for me. It’s a frustratingly worthwhile trade off. Yes, I could’ve said something, but why on earth would I?

I also really believe that most GSRs exceed 20 hours on the regular. At least in my department, GSRs are generally only working on the project they’re funded on, resulting in well over 20 hours per week spent on the project. My office mate has been funded on the same GSR for a couple years, throughout most of which she hasn’t been taking classes and instead works full time on the funded project, which will probably become part of her thesis. It makes sense — it’s mutually beneficial for the student and the PI, because the student gets to make progress on their thesis work, and the PI gets more output and results. It’s a win-win in the research progress department, but it’s a system that results in a lot of unpaid labor.

And to be totally honest, almost none of this would really bother me if it weren’t for the fact that the UC continually characterizes graduate students in press releases and in the media as part time workers who are making a reasonable salary given that we only work 20 hours per week. There’s no hours tracking, so I can’t know for sure, but I would say that on average, the UC gets more than 20 hours per week out of each of us. The system as a whole is set up in a way such that it just makes sense for TAs to contribute more than 20 hours per week when asked, and for GSRs to contribute more than 20 hours per week basically always. The number is fairly arbitrary — it’s not what dictates the amount of work grad students do; the academic system and power dynamics do that. It frustrates me when that number is used to argue against pay increases.

All that being said, I have a feeling we’re in different departments — in my department, it’s a 50/50 split for TAs and GSRs, and we do have a lot of people being paid to do research. To be incredibly clear, you seem like the kind of professor I would want to TA for, who takes student work and priorities seriously, and I’m 99% sure I’m not talking about you here. There are a lot of good faculty out there and I don’t take them for granted. (I’m actually not formally participating in the strike because, for some complicated reasons, it would screw my advisor over if I did… and she is absolutely an ally and a friend to the point that I’m not willing to do that to her.)

The tuition is pretty baseless once they stop taking classes. I’m sure if you’re not taking classes and you’re working as either a TA and/or researcher then your tuition goes to…what exactly? The privilege of being able to work for someone? As for janitors, they should absolutely also get a pay increase. I agree wages should increase across the board for everyone.

With that said, I don’t believe that it’s fair for graduate students to be directly influencing the outcome of an undergrads education by preventing them from attending class, disrupting their courses, etc. The majority of the undergraduates fully support the strike. The main argument from grads is to “take it up with admin” but we can be saying the same to you. Directing this fucked up situation towards eachother is not the answer. If the TA’s want support from the undergraduates in complaining to admin, there are much more polite and efficient ways to do so.",,

It literally against the ridiculous free market narrative that the school places at the center of its Econ classes. They have to pretend is beneath them, because the success of every union is spitting in the face of UCSBs economic propaganda. 

Every time a single mother can feed her children and save money for her retirement at the same time because she’s in a Union, an Econ major recoils in disgust, indicating that unions disrupt “economic equilibrium”. 

Each time a person with a disability or ailment breathes a sigh of relief from being saved by their society due to solidarity or public policy, the people who study Econ at this school would say it’s actually wrong for us to help that person and that if a person with diabetes dies on their bathroom floor, that’s actually okay because we aren’t supposed to “maximize trades”, we have to “maximize profit” which is code word for “we need to let poor people die for this system to work”.

Economics at UCSB is essentially the sanitizing of the death and suffering of capitalism.

Econ majors who believe in capitalism are some if the most vile sociopaths across the world and are responsible for violent fascistic revolutions and death and suffering across the world for hundreds of years, defending anything that lets people who are already wealthy continue to be more wealthy. Look up what Jeffrey Sachs used to do before he started talking shit about capitalism; that’s what this school is training these people to be. Propagandists to tell the wealthy make more money and own more and more and more capital.

I work with a GSR whose PI funds them via an external grant that ends next July, accordingly her PI has her on track to graduate in June before that happens. If she misses that, she may get the summer quarter on filing fee as a buffer, but if she needs to stay in the fall to finish up she'd have to pay tuition out of pocket or use loans because her PI won't have any money to cover her then (unless he brings in another grant - questionable).

Ideally, the university should fund/cover an extra quarter if she needs it via department funding and maybe the success of the strike will get these provisions long term, but right now most departments have been getting their budgets cut by admin so its not something she can rely on in the near term.

It's a difficult and aggravating situation to be have this strike disrupt finals week. There are a few things that I think this post dismisses though, particularly with the sense of what is  ""allowed"" to be disruptive.

First, to address the latter portion of the points made: striking outside of Yang's house would almost certainly not be available as a strategy, as it would likely be construed as trespassing or intimidation. While there are other examples of this happening in different strikes and on different campuses, it does always invite the possibility of police presence. This is dangerous for a strike, and it can be used against the strike in general to contest its ""lawful"" status. Similar things can be said about blocking admin buildings (note buildings). Whether or not the strike does actions like this in a manner that is lawful (or within the rules agreed upon for striking) doesn't really matter, as it can be trumped up against the strike and used to weaken the overall position. 

If you think these rules and laws make strike actions lean towards disrupting undergrad more than admin, you're right. Admin and lawmakers are often of the same interest, and write the rules to deflect blame, accountability, and disruption to their lives. 

As to the other major point about undergrads not being able to do things to support the strike, this is generally untrue but right in that the options are a lot more limited during finals week. Undergrads can petition their professors, join grads on the picket line, write to admin, write their representatives, and encourage their families/parents to write to admin and representatives. These may seem futile, but they build pressure and momentum against the UC. 

As a side note, consider also why professors have not canceled class/finals when it is in their power to do so. Especially important when a number of labor organizations (both faculty and non) have called for a full work stoppage, including testing, grading, teaching, etc. in solidarity with the strike. 

Tl;dr The options for striking lawfully for grads are really limited, and the suggested disruptions raise a number of other issues that would put the strike at risk.

Unions are based on the labor theory of value being true, and the criticisms of capitalism that come from that truth. It's based on Marx's criticism of capitalism. If someone is in a union and doesn't consider themself a Marxist it's because they are uneducated on the subject. Unions are an anti-capitalist (and therefore Marxist) concept. Many of the pro-union arguments that people make are actually Marxist arguments, but the people arguing for a union don't always recognize that.   


You keep saying that the vast majority of people do XYZ, but that doesn't make sense. Neither of us have data on this specific subject, but the macro economic data supports my argument. UCSB is a neoclassical institution, our country has economic data that makes it look like we dont care for unions and don't care for the poor and uses public wealth to give private contractors the money to bomb people and throw people in jail over bullshit. The data available on ""what people think"" in this field is very much in favor of my criticism; feel free to go and become a powerful figure of authority in the U.S. government while advocating openly for Marxism and I will gladly change my opinion.  


Studying economics AT UCSB definitely isn't going to help you empathize with workers... There is no Michael Parenti here, there is no Richard Wolff here, there is no Noam Chomsky here. I have been told that Ebenstein is the only professor who assigns even a shred of Marx, and it's only a small portion of the class because UCSB is ultimately a neoclassical institution and he can't deviate too much from that line.  


Again, I am not saying that EVERYONE is like this. But I have 0 problem saying that most econ majors are probably just going to walk through this school, accept the propaganda, and continue to contribute to this system without any criticism of our society at all.

If someone is in a union and doesn't consider themself a Marxist it's because they are uneducated on the subject. Unions are an anti-capitalist (and therefore Marxist) concept.  


This does not make sense. All western governments have some level of legal protection for unions and labor rights, they are supporting an “anti-capitalist” concept so are they marxist?

\> Many of the pro-union arguments that people make are actually Marxist arguments, but the people arguing for a union don't always recognize that.  


It is possible to support the free market and unions at the same time, I don't know why you are applying a type of “one drop rule” that supporting ANY level of anti-capitalist (capitalism in your implication meaning a completely deregulated economy) ideology makes you a marxist.

\>You keep saying that the vast majority of people do XYZ, but that doesn't make sense. Neither of us have data on this specific subject, but the macro economic data supports my argument. UCSB is a neoclassical institution, our country has economic data that makes it look like we dont care for unions and don't care for the poor and uses public wealth to give private contractors the money to bomb people and throw people in jail over bullshit. The data available on ""what people think"" in this field is very much in favor of my criticism;  


scientist glbal warming...

\>feel free to go and become a powerful figure of authority in the U.S. government while advocating openly for Marxism and I will gladly change my opinion.I totally agree that advocating marxism in the US will get you ostracized.   


Good thing that's not the same thing as advocating for unions, that would mean that the ruling party of the United States is Marxist.

\>Studying economics AT UCSB definitely isn't going to help you empathize with workers... There is no Michael Parenti here, there is no Richard Wolff here, there is no Noam Chomsky here. I have been told that Ebenstein is the only professor who assigns even a shred of Marx, and it's only a small portion of the class because UCSB is ultimately a neoclassical institution and he can't deviate too much from that line.Again, I am not saying that EVERYONE is like this. But I have 0 problem saying that most econ majors are probably just going to walk through this school, accept the propaganda, and continue to contribute to this system without any criticism of our society at all.No wonder they don't want to go on strike. They don't care.

However, it is not the solution for the hundreds of graduates across the entire UC system, living in poverty, many of whom can’t afford to strike, and certainly can’t afford to continue being exploited by an academic system failing to support their education. Maybe one house helps one person; striking helps not only myself avoid living in a shithole for six years with no money, but also other people - those who can’t strike, those who can’t afford to strike - so that maybe they ALSO don’t have to live in a shithole for six years, or don’t have to drive four hours a day after staying up until 3am grading papers.

First of all, we're often lied to about the cost of living here, both by our departments and the university as a whole. I was told you could rent a studio apartment here for $750/month back in 2016. That was a lie.

Second, graduate students often have to go to certain universities with specific professors that hold the same research interests. It's not a situation where you can just go to whichever institution has the cheapest cost of living.

Third, every job should pay a wage that matches the cost of living of its location. If not, who the hell is supposed to TA here? It is absolutely the job of our employers to pay a living wage. We keep the university running.

I've never met a TA who didn't love their undergrads. Literally no TA wants to punish undergrads.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention -- based on your concerns, we are reevaluating our plans for the rest of the week and ended our blockage of these parking lots for today. We chose the parking lots we did because they are the parking lots where administrators and faculty who are crossing our picket line park (near Cheadle hall). However, we did not realize that so many undergrads would be trying to park here as well. And it is clear that we did not do a good enough job communicating to undergrads in cars which parking lots they could go park in, that disabled folks would be let in, etc. We apologize and working to address this for the future.  
We have been talking extensively about all of our actions to try to make them as disruptive to the university as possible while being the least disruptive to students. This is one of the reasons we moved our picket line to Elings hall this week instead of being by the library, and why we are not purposely disrupting classrooms during finals week. UC is putting us in an impossible position between fighting for our own living conditions (wages that allow us to afford rent, feed ourselves and our families, access needs for disabled workers, etc) and interfering with undergrad education. I strongly believe that UC has purposely drawn out negotiations and this strike in order to turn undergrads against grad students as we approach final grades. UC could have remedied their illegal bargaining actions and begin negotiating with us in good faith at any time over the last 3 weeks of the strike (or before we even had to strike!), but they have not. This is not my twitter thread, but I think it does a good job of explaining how UC is using undergrads and faculty to break the strike: https://twitter.com/Richasineatme/status/1598854224695029760. For more info about the strike, check out this FAQ for UCSB undergrads: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULGWj1OgNSrsKglZ2fPe2OreCv0GXGJgMm7MptnrIAo/edit?usp=sharing  
If you have any other questions, let me know. I am not an elected union leader or anything, just a grad worker who is on strike, but I will do my best to address and answer them.",,
251,,,,,Harness that energy and take it to administration. They can stop the strike at any time and let life resume. They just don't want to pay people a living wage.,,
252,,,,,I’m an undergrad and I’ve heard a lot of things about UCSB administration or even UC administration not being the ones who could make the decisions to increase pay so that the strikes stop. Who is it that actually has the power to do that?,,
253,,,,,"So I've stayed out of this because anything outside of 100% support of the strike is downvoted to hell. To clearly state my opinions:

* I in general support a strike (and strikes in general)
* I **strongly** endorse better pay for all educators through all levels of education. Long term I believe a livable wage should be an absolute bare minimum for all educators.
* I do not support our alignment with the UAW (they are a corrupt organization headquartered 2400miles away. I think our union should be aligned with a California specific master union. I think this leads to better outcomes for all parties when Unions are more local.)
* I think the demands of the union are unreasonable for a single contract cycle. I think going for more like a 40% raise to the table (and thus settling for something 20-30%) in more tenable and actually workable for UCs budget. UC needs to increase it's budget via lobbying and other efforts to get this to where TAs can be paid a 100% or so wage to get to livable wages. Rome wasn't built in a day.

That said. I'm scabbing, and nothing you can do will stop me. I knew exactly what my compensation was going to be and what COL was in the area when I elected to come to UCSB for Grad School in 2018. I could have freely chosen from 8 other schools in two countries with various salary/COL ratios. I refuse to let UGs have their experience suffer as a result of the strike. Performing poorly due to inadequate knowledge of class standing, inability to get 1:1 help, etc, could have a profound impact on a UGs life. What if they have med-school aspirations? A poor Ochem grade/knowledge base could kill that dream for them. I'm not going to impede that. I re-entered academia to help kids, fully well knowing I'd be taking a huge financial hit to do so. Fuck me for not willing to make them my pawns right?

I've been in a successful strike in industry during as a ""essential worker"" during COVID. The company brought in contract labor at extreme rates to replace us.  Our customers weren't impact (again, this was essential industry), only the shareholders that had unfair revenue sharing were hurt. It was perfect.

Who are the shareholders here? Its not like my PI rakes in the dough (I can see his exact salary)? He would make 2-3x in private industry. A few high paid administrators that if we split their salaries we could make like $100/extra a year? Ultimately the shareholders are the taxpayers. We need additional support there before we can make meaningful strides in pay.

\*in before administrative bloat argument. Ironic that a ""pro-labor"" movement would suggest cutting jobs in one area to make more money themselves. Many of those hated ""administrators"" bust their to make my life as a grad student better. I'm not going to throw them under the bus either.",,
254,,,,,Why don’t you take it up with admin then? You’re not screwing them over with this. You’re screwing over undergrads. You are directly affecting our grades. A lot of people commute and have to park in order to take finals,,
255,,,,,"Acting like its that black-and-white is childish. There are real impacts to real people (students) here.

The word scab is in the long list of tactics that I wish the union would avoid. Same with telling people to get mad a the nameless ""administration"". It's easy to get people mad at a nameless entity. Guess what that ""administration"" is normal people like you and I performing real jobs and trying to provide their best for the families.",,
256,,,,,"I understand you are here as a representative of the strike and I respect the grievances leveled against the university. However, why were you disrupting classrooms and the library throughout last week? Is there some hidden member of admin in the library studying during dead week?",,
257,,,,,Lot 12 was completely full. The closest open lot was at the thunderdome. What were you telling folks with disabilities? You think telling a student their professor SHOULD be understanding makes this any less stressful for undergrads? That being late to a final doesn’t affect their ability to do well on it? You are alienating your supporters. Reconsider this strategy,,
258,,,,,"probably because you have zero bargaining power or position. One result of this might be the removal of sections altogether, which honestly sounds like the best thing for me personally (unless you have labs, math, ect.) Sections for the humanities and social sciences so far have bene utter BS, not constructive and not increasing our understanding of the texts. In my first quarter here, My section leader SHOULD have discussed and went into the incredibly dense amount of reading we had, but instead we focused on benign definitions and how to write essays properly... 

Obviously I'm only speaking for myself based on my experience, but the sections seem derivative, especially since so far my classes have been dependent on teaching yourself anyways, you either do the assignments and the reading or you don't.

Also, the tactics being employed are neither helpful or informative, they're just annoying. You're turning people away from your movement for the sake of ""solidarity"" and showing your ""virtuosity"" in the situation, but when it comes down to it ya'll just come across as cry babies. It'd be cool if you guys had higher wages, and it's fucked that housing is so expensive here, but based on my interactions with TAs you guys don't paint a pretty picture which incurs empathy.",,
259,,,,,That’s not our fault tho. You’re screwing over undergrads that can’t do anything to help you,,
260,,,,,"Having a terrible salary and a HCOL only helps maintain the status quo of people from privileged backgrounds having access to grad opportunities because they are the only ones that can afford to take such a hit. You can knowingly join an institution with the goal of making it more equitable, accesible, and generally better without being a hypocrite. Enough with the YoU KnEW WhAT YoU WEre GeTtiNG INTo rhetoric.",,
261,,,,,Harness that energy and take it to administration. They can stop the strike at any time and let life resume. They're screwing over TAs and undergrads.,,
262,,,,,You admit to being a scab in this same comment section. Of course you think the word is “in the long list of tactics that the union should avoid” lol. Shame!,,
263,,,,,"how was I making the situation out to be black and white? I was observing that this thread has more people against the strike in it. Seems like you just had that condescending lib-insult loaded in the chamber lmfao

I didn't endorse this particular tactic nor do I think all scabs are bad people. I perfectly understand people do what they have to do for themselves and their families.",,
264,,,,,I think they have admin and students mixed up so that’s why they’ve been trying to bother undergrads,,
265,,,,,"Bro, you’ve replied to 5 of my comments telling me i’m an undergrad. i work as an undergraduate learning assistant. i conduct my own office hours, grade assignments, and am present at section. i do the same work as TAs. i have every right to strike and every reason to strike.",,
266,,,,,">  You’re screwing over undergrads that can’t do anything to help you

Untrue, if more and more people, including undergrads take these grievances to administration our collective voice will be louder and harder to ignore.",,
267,,,,,"Complain to the administration. They're the ones who have failed to provide you the education that you expected due to the low wages that led to this strike. They're the ones who have pushed TAs to this position. 

You're a ""customer"" of this university and you should be upset. But putting the blame on the low-paid peons who have had enough isn't going to get you anywhere. The peons (TAs) do mostly care about your education but are also getting fed up with subsidizing it through their low pay.",,
268,,,,,"There are undergrads in our union and we are grateful that some of them are striking with us! Any undergrad who is a TA, tutor, or reader can join our union and strike with us.",,
269,,,,,"I agree. Which is why I support higher wages for Grad students (or even a UBI+public health to give better safety nets for the under-privileged so they can freely access their dreams).

You can support a strike without support **this** strike.

 Is going to a employer with demands for a 100% pay wage ""bargaining in good faith?"". The knife cuts bot ways.",,
270,,,,,"Sorry. I was overly sensitive as a ""scab"" myself. That word has a harsh negative connotation. I'm not ""scabbing"" for my own benefit. I'm scabbing because kids in my section struggle without TA sessions and availability. I don't really want them to fall behind as a result of the strike.",,
271,,,,,"I'm replying so others are aware. My understanding of the strike is that the main issue is getting a living wage. Part time work is different than full time work/research, as should be the expectations of the same.",,
272,,,,,Yeah well you’re not making us want to go to admin on your behalf. You’re making us not support the strike,,
273,,,,,"I understand that, just like how white people marched with MLKJ. Doesn't mean the white people should have spoken for the black people, right? Undergrads shouldn't be speaking in terms of ""we"" and ""our"" because it implies they are in the aggrieved party when they aren't.",,
274,,,,,Wtf my husband is STEM and his entire department is striking/in support of the strike.....,,
275,,,,,"Whoever you are, you're a terrible representative for this strike. If you can't think outside of buzzwords, then you're not an effective communicator. This isn't Twitter where you say ""victim blaming"" and automatically win the argument.",,
276,,,,,"take this frustration to the university. they can stop the strike and any inconvenience it causes by bringing a fair contract to the table today. 

you can also absolutely speak to the faculty and explain what was going on. it’s not ur fault, and you’re supposed to be given a make-up or an NG which should not affect you.",,
277,,,,,"The more support the strike has the sooner it will end and the lessen the harm to undergrads. Undermining your colleagues isn’t helping undergrads, especially in the long term.",,
278,,,,,"You're right about the negative connotation, so I get your reaction.

Some people can't be on the picket-line and that doesn't make them bad (which people in your situation are not reminded of to say the least😂) but, as a whole the strike is just in my view so it's good to support it. 

Glad to work it out with a fellow gaucho lol.",,
279,,,,,that is not the only element of the strike.,,
280,,,,,Why are grad students making undergrads late to their finals when grad students got all their finals moved off site.,,
281,,,,,"No one can ""make"" you do anything. You arrive at your own conclusions on your own. If you don't like the strike that's your prerogative, but it's gotten this bad because of administration issues. It's not like this strike is happening because it's ""fun"".",,
282,,,,,"If they are a TA, tutor, reader, they are in our union and have the exact same claim to striking / grievances against UC / this fight as grad students do. UC's negotiators have taken illegal action against their (our) union and are not bargaining in good faith. UAW2865 negotiates the contracts that undergrad TAs, tutors, readers work under. There is no difference between undergrad and grad strikers.",,
283,,,,,Not all strikes are equal. Scabbing in one case is not the same as scabbing in another.,,
284,,,,,"If more support is instrumental to ending the strike quickly, how does blocking parking lots and alienating supporters fit into that strategy?",,
285,,,,,"I care about my undergrads now. I'm not looking to nuke their long term job or further education prospects. Students aren't tradeable commodities. Helping a UG 3 years down the road doesn't help my current students. Sorry, that's my choice. You can make your own.",,
286,,,,,"Oh please. Go find me a list of administrators that are ""lining their pockets"".

Here is the list of all UC System Salaries for you: [https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2021/university-of-california/?page=4](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2021/university-of-california/?page=4)

The first 10 pages are:

* Doctors associated with UC Medical
   * UC Medical provides profits **back** to the UC system, decreasing tuition and/or increasing revenue to increase pay in other departments
   * Also, good luck attracting doctors to the UC system without paying them near market rates
* Football coaches

Want to take Yang's salary down to $250k and spread that $250k across the \~5,000 of us? Yay! We can all get $50/year raises.",,
287,,,,,"The grievances are obviously different. Tutors and readers are not full time workers like grad students are. Clearly the union has enlisted the UG tutors and readers merely for their numbers.

From UAW:

>Build community and create solidarity. As Audre Lorde writes, “Without community, there is no liberation.” UAW 2865 sees itself as part of a broader movement for justice, understanding that an injury to one is truly an injury to all.

How exactly is blocking the lots and protesting the library building community and creating solidarity? It's doing the exact opposite.",,
288,,,,,"But for the most part, each and everyone one of us grad students with financial support letters knew what to expect financially. It is hard to be upset with the Uni. However, no one anticipated the most recent upticks in living costs and so I sympathize with the sentiment that the Uni needs to do something to help us out. 

Though a blanket wage increase might not be the best way to do that. Regardless, the UAW wants blanket wage increases because members pay a fixed % of their salary to UAW.",,
289,,,,,"I respect this person for it. I joined the strike but have since changed my mind and resumed work. Demanding blanket salary increase as much as 54k (I am not sure what the updated ask is) is ridiculous. Even if that number was made in anticipation of some bargaining down, I think that prolonging this strike through such tactics is bad for everyone. I hate our union, they don't seem to want to represent the preferences of student workers. They appear to care more about monetary gains.",,
290,,,,,"Okay so you're saying that if a strike starts at my place of work demanding a safer working environment, and I'm a scab in that case, that's equivalent to scabbing if a strike demands immediately adding a zero to the end of every lower employee's salary, while also taking away a zero from the upper management's salary?

Like, the demands simply do not come into play? If a strike starts, one simply must support it, regardless of the demands? That's obviously wrong. A strike is a type of protest and surely you don't support every protest you come across.",,
291,,,,,">So did they know what to expect or was it unanticipated?

They should expect to be unable to weather financial shocks well and it is, by definition, hard to expect shocks. There's plenty of resources that the university makes available to students in such situations but I think they should do more like give more resources to students who apply for them and demonstrate need.

&#x200B;

>Perhaps, but it's what other grad students believe they need to continue  
 to live, rather than constantly struggle to survive in this   
economically inflated period. People making higher salaries have the   
benefit of a monetary cushion to mitigate inflation, grad students do   
not.

I'm sure many think this but many others do not. There are plenty of grad students who dont need such a generous adjustment. It seems the UAW calculated how much money a student would need in the worst case scenario and made that their ask which is a tall order for the University. UAW's bargaining approach is aggressive which is not ideal for anyone imo.",,
292,,,,,"You can respect them all you want. My point is that they don’t _deserve_ respect from striking workers. I have problems with the union too, but it’s still better than no union, and we are poised to reform not only our local but the entire UAW through the most recent election.",,
293,,,,,"You’re ignoring a lot of context here, especially in your protest example. A strike is voted on by the workers. If the majority of your fellow workers vote to go on strike, and you continue to do work which undermines their strike, you’re scabbing and supporting the bosses against your fellow workers.",,
294,,,,,"i've gotten into multiple med schools this very cycle. TAs are a wonderful tool, but any competent premed student should be able to seek out the hundreds of free resources around the premed required subjects. and if one truly depends on their TAs that much, then they should see more than anyone that the help they can give can only be so effective while they are struggling for housing and food, and support the strike even more for that reason.",,
295,,,,,"I think they deserve respect for honestly stating their opinion unapologetically even if it risks backlash. They’re not actively encouraging scabbing imo. Besides, you can’t completely scab because uaw gets money from student workers automatically no matter what.",,
296,,,,,"So food purchased with the funds paid from people who bought meal plans was given away without at least recovering the cost? That's not liberation. That's theft.

A theft not too different than the what the UC is doing to TAs.

To the folks pulling misguided stunts, be better. Stop hurting the undergrads.",,
297,,,,,"But they didn’t take from those of us with meal plans, in fact those of us with meal plans also got free food. The only one who took a loss here is the university. So unless the university decides to up the price of meal plans to compensate or something this hurts no one except the university. Now if you feel stealing from the university is wrong that’s fine, but don’t act like this hurt us undergrads somehow",,
298,,,,,"Dining service is primarily funded by meal plans. The food and everything stolen was purchased from the pockets of the undergrads currently attending. 

If you don't understand something as simple as how meal plans fund a dining service then you probably are wasting your time pursuing a college degree.",,
299,,,,,I think they should strike for as long as they can; really make em sweat. Pretty much not until grades absolutely need to be posted,,
300,,,,,"We did not do any of the graffiti. I don't know who did, but it was NOT the union",,
301,,,,,"This is such an ignorant and selfish thing to say.
Your quality of education wouldn’t be possible without the academic employees who are paid unlivable wages, but based on your response and lack of empathy it seems that you haven’t taken advantage of your education",,
302,,,,,"Right cause the educated thing to do would be to protest the library and block parking lots during finals to screw over the undergrads who are too busy to picket with you right now, rather than just holding steady till the break then coming back in January with UG support since they'll have next to nothing to do right when the quarter starts.

You can brag about your education but you look fucking stupid.",,
303,,,,,Oh boo. The strike is incredibly unproductive and their demands will never be met because they are unreasonable. They are not getting paid higher because it’s not a real job. The strikers are living in a fantasy land. My academics are going just fine.,,
304,,,,,"I read the news about the parking lot being blocked this morning and I completely agree that’s it’s unnecessarily disrupting students who’re just trying to study for or take their finals. I still stand by what I said, because you’re trying to use that incident to portray the entire strike as unproductive in order to distort and minimize it.
Academic employees being exploited and denied basic livable wages is still more pressing.
To me, anyone who dismisses that and tries to use this incident to discredit the entire strike sounds stupid.

Besides, the point of the strike IS to disrupt education in order to highlight how central TAs and academic employees are to our education. If professors refuse to provide some class wide compensation/ be understanding to people who were late to their finals because of the disruption (finals that are typically graded by the TAs by the way), they should be more upset with the professor than the strikers.",,
305,,,,,"The strikers have posted plenty of information on how their demands are reasonable and can be met. If you still think that the jobs of academic employees aren’t real jobs or that the administration isn’t being greedy, that still goes to show how unappreciative and out of touch you are.",,
306,,,,,"You are actually ignorant if you think strikes don’t have utility for laborers. Maybe you get help from your parents for rent, but a lot of people don’t. I don’t understand how you are opposed to adequate living conditions for people working  to make our education happen.",,
307,,,,,"I have read about it and I still find it to be highly unreasonable. Yes, some student employees are useful, but a lot are really just lucky to be here. They are getting their tuition paid and a degree out of this and to demand more reeks of privilege. The strike is out of touch and when these people get out into the real world they will see how good they had it here.",,
308,,,,,"A lot of the academic employees are rent burdened, being paid poverty level wages, and not guaranteed housing. Some are even homeless, there was one TA at UCSD who was homeless for 3 months. I have no idea where you got the idea that they’re “reeking of privilege”.",,
309,,,,,"They're not trying to be rich, they're just trying to have some quality of life?

And I think it's dumb to be looking at this as if the strikes exist outside of supply and demand. They're striking because they can, because unions allow them to, and they feel they deserve it. Regardless of how you or I feel about it, they're going on strike until they feel they have a fair contract. 

At the end of the day, they're providing their service through knowledge and time in return for degrees and some money. The university gets cheap labor, better student/faculty ratios, and better curriculum. As long as the people feels there's an imbalance, there's always going to be strikes and dissent.",,
310,,,,,"> If their skilled labor is truly in demand then they will get paid more

Exactly the point of the strike!",,
311,,,,,Btw it’s the same format as the regular right? Her TAs aren’t on strike?,,
312,,,,,"yes I believe it's the same format, strike does not affect this class. good luck to you! let's move to 136c in winter quarter!",,
313,,,,,"Sitting through multiple regular chem finals making sure I have the correct seat and brought my access card with me to now seeing everything being taken online and straight up getting canceled is unfair. Then again , there's people who don't want others to get out of drowning debt with help from the gov because they think it's unfair...as someone who has experienced both, before the start of covid and after, at ucsb I think that it's hard not to feel this way, but easier to try to understand from the TAs perspective as a graduate student who also is also faced the strike.",,
